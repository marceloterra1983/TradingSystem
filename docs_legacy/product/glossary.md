# Glossary - TradingSystem

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** January 2025

---

## Trading Terms

### A

**Aggressor**
- The party that initiates a trade (buyer or seller)
- 'B' = Buy aggressor (market buy order)
- 'S' = Sell aggressor (market sell order)
- Used to identify market sentiment and flow

**Ask / Offer**
- The lowest price a seller is willing to accept
- Also called "offer price"
- Opposite of bid

**Asset**
- A tradable financial instrument
- Examples: WINZ25 (futures), PETR4 (stock)

### B

**Bid**
- The highest price a buyer is willing to pay
- Opposite of ask

**Book Delta**
- Difference between bid and ask quantities
- Formula: `ask_qty - bid_qty`
- Indicates order book imbalance

**Backtest**
- Testing a trading strategy on historical data
- Used to validate strategy before live trading

### C

**Cause-and-Effect Model**
- ML model that identifies relationships between market conditions (causes) and price movements (effects)
- Core algorithm of TradingSystem

**Circuit Breaker**
- Mechanism to halt trading during extreme volatility
- Prevents system from making trades during abnormal market conditions

**Confidence Score**
- Probability assigned to a trading signal (0-1)
- Higher confidence = stronger signal
- Threshold typically set at 0.65

### D

**Day Trade**
- Position opened and closed on the same trading day
- Type 1 in ProfitDLL

**Drawdown**
- Peak-to-trough decline in account value
- Measured as percentage or absolute value
- Key risk metric

### E

**Exchange**
- Marketplace where securities are traded
- 'B' = B3 (Brazilian stock exchange)
- 'BVMF' = BM&F (futures exchange)

**Execution**
- Process of completing a trade order
- Includes order placement, matching, and confirmation

### F

**Feature Engineering**
- Creating predictive variables from raw market data
- Examples: aggressor flow, volatility, momentum

**FIFO (First-In-First-Out)**
- Queue processing method
- Used for buffer management in WebSocket

**Fill**
- Order execution confirmation
- Partial fill = partially executed order
- Full fill = completely executed order

### H

**Hit Rate**
- Percentage of profitable signals
- Formula: `winning_trades / total_trades * 100`
- Target: > 60%

**Historical Data**
- Past market data used for backtesting and analysis
- Retrieved via ProfitDLL `GetHistoryTrades`

### K

**Kill Switch**
- Emergency stop mechanism
- Halts all trading immediately
- Accessible via API endpoint `/risk/kill-switch`

### L

**Latency**
- Time delay in data processing
- Measured from data capture to decision
- Target: < 500ms (P95)

**Limit Order**
- Order to buy/sell at a specific price or better
- Not guaranteed to execute

**Liquidity**
- Ability to buy/sell without affecting price significantly
- High liquidity = tight spreads, large volumes

### M

**Market Order**
- Order to buy/sell immediately at current market price
- Guaranteed execution (if market is open)
- Price in ProfitDLL: -1

**ML (Machine Learning)**
- Algorithms that learn from data
- Used for signal generation in TradingSystem

### O

**OCO (One-Cancels-Other)**
- Two orders where execution of one cancels the other
- Common for stop-loss + take-profit combos

**Order Book**
- List of buy and sell orders at various price levels
- Also called "limit order book" or "depth"

**Order ID**
- Unique identifier for an order
- `ClOrderID` (string) or `LocalOrderID` (long) in ProfitDLL

### P

**P&L (Profit and Loss)**
- Financial result of trading activity
- Realized P&L = closed positions
- Unrealized P&L = open positions

**P95 (95th Percentile)**
- Performance metric: 95% of measurements are below this value
- Used for latency targets

**Parquet**
- Columnar storage format for efficient data storage
- Used for tick data, features, signals

**Position**
- Current holding in an asset
- Long = bought, Short = sold

**ProfitDLL**
- Nelogica's data solution library
- Provides market data and order execution capabilities

### R

**Risk Engine**
- Component that enforces trading limits
- Checks: daily loss, position size, trading hours

**Rolling Window**
- Moving calculation over N recent data points
- Example: 100-tick rolling average

### S

**SGDClassifier**
- Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier
- ML algorithm used for incremental learning

**Sharpe Ratio**
- Risk-adjusted return metric
- Formula: `(return - risk_free_rate) / volatility`
- Target: > 1.5

**Signal**
- Trading recommendation generated by ML model
- Values: BUY, SELL, HOLD
- Includes confidence score and justification

**Slippage**
- Difference between expected and actual execution price
- Caused by market movement during order placement

**Stop Order / Stop Loss**
- Order triggered when price reaches specified level
- Used to limit losses

### T

**Tick**
- Smallest price movement in a security
- Also refers to individual trade event

**Ticker / Symbol**
- Unique identifier for a tradable asset
- Format: "ASSET:EXCHANGE" (e.g., "WINZ25:B")

**Timestamp**
- Exact time an event occurred
- Format: Unix epoch milliseconds

### V

**Volatility**
- Measure of price variation over time
- High volatility = larger price swings

**Volume**
- Number of contracts/shares traded
- Indicator of market activity

### W

**WebSocket**
- Protocol for real-time bidirectional communication
- Used for streaming market data (port 9001)

## Technical Terms

### A

**Aggregate (DDD)**
- Cluster of domain objects treated as a single unit
- Examples: OrderAggregate, PositionAggregate

**API Gateway**
- Central entry point for all API requests
- Routes to appropriate microservices

### C

**Clean Architecture**
- Layered software design pattern
- Layers: Domain → Application → Infrastructure → Presentation
