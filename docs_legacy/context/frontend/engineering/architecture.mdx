This page highlights the core architectural principles for TradingSystem frontends. For the detailed breakdown, see [Frontend Architecture Overview](../architecture/overview.md).

## Layout & Navigation

- React Router v6 powers page routes with lazy-loaded bundles and Suspense fallbacks.
- Shared shell components (`components/layout/*`) provide the customizable dashboard experience.

## State & Data Flow

- Zustand manages UI state (layout settings, filters).
- React Query handles server data for Idea Bank and TP Capital integrations.
- Local Storage persists layout preferences for MVP use cases.

## Integration Points

- REST APIs: Idea Bank (`http://localhost:3200/api`) and TP Capital (`http://localhost:4005`) feed dashboard views.
- WebSocket streaming is planned for real-time status updates; see roadmap in the architecture overview.
