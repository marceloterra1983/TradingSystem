## Build Steps

- Execute `npm run build` to validate production bundles.
- Ensure environment variables referenced in `.env.example` are documented before releasing.

## CI Integrations

- CI must run linting (`npm run lint`) and tests (`npm run test`) before build.
- `npm run docs:auto` should run when PRs touch documentation or design tokens to keep generated files current.
- Include PRD and Frontend impact notes in pull requests so reviewers can trace required documentation changes.
