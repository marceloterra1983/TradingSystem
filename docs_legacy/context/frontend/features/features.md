# Feature Catalogue (Frontend)

Use this catalogue to orient yourself before diving into the detailed feature docs.

| Feature | Description | Spec |
|---------|-------------|------|
| Idea Bank | Curated list of research ideas with tagging, status tracking, and inline metrics. | [feature-idea-bank.md](feature-idea-bank.md) |
| Telegram Connections | Manage Telegram bot credentials and channel configurations with real-time connection monitoring. | [feature-telegram-connections.md](feature-telegram-connections.md) |
| TP-Capital Table | QuestDB-backed table and logs for TP Capital Telegram signals integrated into Banco de Dados. | [feature-tp-capital-signals.md](feature-tp-capital-signals.md) |

## Adding a New Feature Doc

1. Create `feature-<slug>.md` with front matter (title, tags, summary, status, last_review).
2. Document user flows, API contracts, UI snapshots, and analytics hooks.
3. Update this index so readers can find the new feature quickly.
