# Frontend Documentation Overview

Frontend documentation is organized into three tracks:

- **Design System** — canonical design tokens, components, and reusable patterns.
- **Guidelines** — style, accessibility, internationalization, and performance practices.
- **Engineering** — architecture conventions, tooling, testing, and CI build expectations.

## Quick Links

- [Gemini CLI theme migration](./guidelines/style-guide.mdx#gemini-cli-theme)
- [Dashboard architecture overview](./engineering/architecture.mdx)
- [Design token source files](../../frontend/shared/styles/tokens.md)

> Use `npm run docs:new -- --type frontend --path frontend/<section>/<slug>` to scaffold new pages with the correct template once the automation step ships.
