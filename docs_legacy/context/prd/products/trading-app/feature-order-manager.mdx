## 1. Summary

Outline how the automated order manager enforces risk controls before sending orders to ProfitDLL.

## 2. Goals

- Enforce daily loss limits and position sizing before each order.
- Provide operators with actionable feedback when orders are rejected.

## 3. Non-Goals

- Does not redesign the ProfitDLL integration layer.

## 4. Background

- Existing dashboards lack visibility into rejected orders and breach reasons.

## 5. User Stories

- `As a risk analyst, I need clear rejection reasons so I can adjust trading parameters quickly.`

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

- Order manager rejects requests exceeding configured limits with structured error payloads.
- Rejections are surfaced in the dashboard with actionable messaging.

## 7. Dependencies

- SDD: /sdd/trading/order-manager
- API: /redoc/order-manager
- Frontend: /frontend/engineering/conventions

## 8. UX/UI References

- Link to dashboard wireframes once ready.

## 9. Metrics

- Track rejection counts per rule.

## 10. Open Questions

- Should we persist per-order audit logs or aggregate summaries?
