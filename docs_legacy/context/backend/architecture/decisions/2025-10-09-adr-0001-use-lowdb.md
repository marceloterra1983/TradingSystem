# ADR-0001: Use LowDB for MVP Persistence

## Context

- The Idea Bank API and Documentation API needed a lightweight datastore for the first public milestone.
- The platform is currently single-user, running locally, and the combined dataset is < 500 records.
- Development velocity was prioritised to unblock the documentation dashboard and idea backlog features.
- Introducing PostgreSQL/Timescale at this stage would require infrastructure work, migrations, and additional operational overhead that the team cannot yet staff.

## Decision

Adopt **LowDB** (file-backed JSON store) as the persistence layer for both Node APIs during the MVP phase.  
Store data in version-controlled JSON files (`db/ideas.json`, `db/db.json`) and load them via LowDB adapters at runtime.

## Consequences

**Pros**
- Minimal setup: no external services or credentials required for developers.
- Fast iteration while modeling API contracts and UI flows.
- Works offline and keeps deployment footprint aligned with the "local only" objective.

**Cons / Risks**
- Concurrency and transactional guarantees are weak; corrupt files would impact all users.
- Scaling beyond a single user or > 1k records becomes impractical.
- Lack of relational constraints complicates reporting and cross-entity queries.

## Follow-up / Review

- Monitor dataset growth and file sizes via the data quality runbook.
- Prepare the migration plan documented in `docs/context/backend/data/migrations/`.
- Revisit this ADR when multi-user access, auditing, or integrations require relational storage (target: migrate to PostgreSQL/Timescale with Prisma or equivalent ORM).
