## üéØ Impact Assessment

### Minimal Impact ‚úÖ

- **No breaking changes** - Components were not actively used
- **No data loss** - No user data or configurations affected
- **No service disruption** - No running services depend on removed components

### Dashboard Navigation

**Before**: Settings section had 3 items
- Connections
- MCP Control
- Agents ‚Üê Removed

**After**: Settings section has 2 items
- Connections
- MCP Control

## üìù Notes for Future Reference

### Agents Scheduler Context

The removed components were part of a previous architecture that included:
- Multi-agent orchestration via MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- Automated agent scheduling and execution
- Real-time monitoring dashboard (port 3847)

These features have been **deprecated** and replaced by:
- **LangGraph** (port 8111) - Multi-agent workflow orchestration
- **LlamaIndex** (port 3450) - Document retrieval and Q&A
- Simplified orchestration without complex scheduling

### Files Preserved

The following files contain "scheduler" but are **NOT** related to agents and were **preserved**:
- `docs/context/ops/deployment/scheduled-tasks.md` - OS-level task scheduling (Windows Task Scheduler)
- `docs/context/ops/automation/backup-job.md` - Backup automation
- External dependencies in `infrastructure/firecrawl/` (third-party examples)

## üîó Related Changes

This cleanup is part of the broader infrastructure improvements including:
- Centralized environment variables (`.env`)
- Docker Compose consolidation
- Security hardening
- Documentation standardization

- `docs/context/ops/ENVIRONMENT-CONFIGURATION.md`
- `docs/context/ops/infrastructure/CENTRALIZED-ENV-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`
- `infrastructure/README.md`
