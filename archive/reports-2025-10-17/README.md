## 📋 Why These Reports Were Archived

These reports document **completed implementations, analyses, and one-time tasks** from October 2025. They have been archived because:

1. ✅ **Tasks are complete** - No ongoing work or active reference needed
2. 📚 **Historical value** - Preserved for audit trail and decision history
3. 🎯 **Consolidation** - Some replaced by consolidated summaries in active reports
4. 🧹 **Organization** - Reduce clutter in active reports directory

**Note:** All reports are preserved, just relocated for better organization.
