# Experimental Scripts

⚠️ **EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES - USE AT YOUR OWN RISK**

This directory contains experimental scripts that are not yet stable or fully tested.

## 📂 Structure

```
experimental/
└── buildkit/          # Docker BuildKit optimization scripts
```

## ⚠️ General Warning

Scripts in this directory are:

- **Not production-ready** - May have bugs or incomplete features
- **Not fully tested** - Limited testing in edge cases
- **Subject to change** - May be modified or removed without notice
- **Not officially supported** - Use at your own risk

## 🧪 When to Use

Use experimental scripts when:

- ✅ You're exploring new features or optimizations
- ✅ You're willing to troubleshoot issues
- ✅ You have backups and can recover if something breaks
- ✅ You're in a development/testing environment (not production)

## 🚫 When NOT to Use

Avoid experimental scripts when:

- ❌ You're in production
- ❌ You don't understand what the script does
- ❌ You don't have backups
- ❌ You can't afford downtime
- ❌ You're on a deadline

## 📋 Best Practices

1. **Read the script** before running it
2. **Understand the risks** documented in subdirectory READMEs
3. **Test in development** first
4. **Create backups** before making changes
5. **Document your experience** for others

## 🔄 Graduation Path

When experimental scripts prove stable and useful:

1. **Testing Phase** - Extended testing in multiple environments
2. **Documentation** - Comprehensive usage guide
3. **Code Review** - Team approval
4. **Migration** - Move to appropriate stable directory
5. **Update References** - Update all documentation

## 📝 Contributing

If you're adding a new experimental script:

1. Create a subdirectory for related scripts
2. Add a README explaining purpose and risks
3. Include usage examples
4. Document known issues
5. Add rollback instructions
