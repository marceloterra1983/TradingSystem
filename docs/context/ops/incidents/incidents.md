# Incident Library

Use this section to quickly find precedent when diagnosing new issues.

| Incident | Trigger | Response Doc |
|----------|---------|--------------|
| Idea Bank downtime | Node API hung after malformed payload | [incident-idea-bank-down.md](incident-idea-bank-down.md) |
| ProfitDLL reconnect storm | Connectivity lost during market open | [incident-profitdll-reconnect.md](incident-profitdll-reconnect.md) |

## How to Document New Incidents

1. Capture a timeline with precise timestamps (HH:mm:ss).
2. Summarize root cause, mitigation, and follow-up actions.
3. Link related automation or monitoring docs for cross-navigation.
