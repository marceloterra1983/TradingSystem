# Product Requirements Hub

Use this space to coordinate product requirements for TradingSystem applications. PRD content is grouped by product so teams can track active features, templates, and archived work.

## Getting Started

1. Review the [templates](./templates/prd-template.mdx) before drafting new content.
2. Create a PRD page per feature inside the relevant product folder (for example, [`products/trading-app`](./products/trading-app/prd-overview.mdx)).
3. Keep the dependencies section synced with system design docs, API references, and frontend components.
