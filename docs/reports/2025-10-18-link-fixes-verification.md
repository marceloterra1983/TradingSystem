# External Link Fixes Verification Report

**Date**: 2025-10-18
**Branch**: chore/rename-containers
**Commit**: f00694b

## Summary

Successfully fixed all external relative links in documentation files that were pointing outside `/docs` directory. All such links have been converted to absolute GitHub URLs to prevent 404 errors in the built Docusaurus site.

## Files Updated

### 1. `docs/context/ops/infrastructure/reverse-proxy-setup.md`

**Total Changes**: 8 link conversions + replacement of "your-org" placeholders

**Links Fixed**:
1. Line 85: Nginx Proxy README (detailed setup guide)
2. Line 279-280: Nginx Proxy README (troubleshooting & production deployment)
3. Line 319-320: SSL/TLS setup guides (production deployment & VPS migration)
4. Line 329: Performance tuning reference
5. Line 338: Monitoring reference
6. Line 347: Security hardening reference
7. Lines 372-374: Infrastructure documentation (README, config, VPS guide)
8. Lines 377-382: Service documentation (workspace, tp-capital, b3, docs, firecrawl, launcher)

**Pattern Applied**:
```markdown
# Before (relative path)
[Service](../../../../backend/api/service/README.md)

# After (absolute GitHub URL)
[Service](https://github.com/marceloterra1983/TradingSystem/blob/main/backend/api/service/README.md)
```

**Placeholder Replacements**:
- All instances of `your-org` replaced with `marceloterra1983`
- Links now point to actual repository

### 2. `docs/context/backend/api/firecrawl-proxy.md`

**Status**: ✅ No changes needed

**Verification**: All links in this file are either:
- Internal to `/docs` (using correct relative paths like `../../shared/diagrams/...`)
- Already converted to absolute GitHub URLs
- External resource links (correct format)

## Verification Steps

1. ✅ Scanned both files for external relative links (`../../../../` pattern)
2. ✅ Converted all external links to absolute GitHub URLs
3. ✅ Replaced organization placeholders with actual values
4. ✅ Verified internal docs links remain as relative paths
5. ✅ Committed changes with descriptive message
6. ✅ Created verification report

## Links Preserved as Relative (Correct)

Internal documentation links within `/docs` remain as relative paths (e.g., `../service-port-map.md`, `../../shared/diagrams/...`). These are correct and will resolve properly in Docusaurus.

## Testing Notes

While a full build test was attempted, there is an unrelated build error in `health-monitoring.md` (MDX compilation issue on line 561). This error is not related to our link fixes and existed before our changes.

The link changes themselves are syntactically correct and follow the established pattern used elsewhere in the documentation.

## Commit Details

**Commit Hash**: f00694b
**Message**: docs(links): fix external relative links in reverse-proxy-setup to use GitHub URLs

**Conventional Commit Type**: docs (documentation changes)

**Files Changed**: 1 file, 135 insertions(+), 22 deletions(-)

## Impact

- ✅ **Build Safety**: Eliminates 404 errors for external resource links
- ✅ **User Experience**: Users can now access referenced files via clickable links
- ✅ **Maintenance**: Clear pattern for future documentation updates
- ✅ **Consistency**: Aligns with existing documentation standards

## Recommendations

1. **Build Fix**: Address the unrelated MDX compilation error in `health-monitoring.md` (line 561)
2. **Link Validation**: Consider adding automated link checking to CI/CD pipeline
3. **Documentation Standard**: Update documentation guidelines to specify when to use absolute vs relative links
