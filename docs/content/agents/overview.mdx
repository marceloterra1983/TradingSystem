# Agents Overview

All legacy multi-agent stacks were retired as part of the automation cleanup. This page tracks the current status and the requirements for the next-generation automation layer.

## 📌 Current Status

- **Active agents:** none.
- **Context provider:** LlamaIndex collections (workspace/docs).
- **Execution hosts:** Kestra + custom Node.js/TypeScript scripts.
- **Legacy services:** Multi-agent stacks have been permanently removed.

## 🧭 Migration Targets

| Area | Requirement | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Monitoring | Ensure Kestra workflows expose Prometheus metrics | ✅ Existing |
| Data Access | Reuse `tp_capital_signals` + Workspace APIs | ✅ Stable |
| Automation | New orchestration will run as Kestra flows or lightweight Node workers | 🟡 In design |
| Prompting | Maintain shared prompt library under `/prompts` with LlamaIndex variables | ✅ Active |

## 🔜 Next Steps

1. Define replacement automation engine (likely Kestra flows + serverless scripts).
2. Standardize prompt + variable contracts around LlamaIndex/Ollama only.
3. Provide reference implementation (proof-of-concept) before re-introducing autonomous agents.

> Until the new architecture lands, downstream systems should interact directly with the core APIs (TP Capital, Telegram Gateway, Workspace) instead of relying on agent endpoints.
