## Summary

Node-based microservice that ingests TP Capital Telegram messages, normalizes the payload, and writes records into QuestDB. The service (`backend/api/tp-capital`) runs on Node.js 20 with Express, persists data to QuestDB, and exposes normalized trading signals via REST on port 3200. It listens to Telegram channels, enriches payloads, and writes time-series records that power the Dashboard and downstream automations.

## Stakeholders

- **Primary users**: Dashboard UI consumers, Agno Agents (market analysis)
- **Operators**: DevOps team managing QuestDB and Telegram bot credentials
- **Downstream systems**: Dashboard (port 3103), Agno Agents framework

## User Journeys

### Journey 1: Signal Ingestion

1. Telegram bot receives message from TP Capital channel.
2. Service parses message extracting asset, buy range, targets, stop.
3. Validates payload structure.
4. Writes to QuestDB via ILP protocol (&lt;500ms p95 latency).
5. Signal available via REST API for dashboard consumption.

### Journey 2: Dashboard Consumption

1. Dashboard polls `/signals` endpoint every 15 seconds.
2. Receives paginated list of normalized signals.
3. Displays in TP Capital table page with filters (channel, signal type).
4. Auto-refresh keeps data current.

### Journey 3: Agent Integration

1. Agno Agents query `/signals` endpoint.
2. Combine Telegram signals with Workspace ideas and B3 market data.
3. Apply risk controls and compliance checks.
4. Generate trading recommendations.

## SLA Metrics

- **Ingestion latency**: &lt;500ms p95 (Telegram webhook â†’ QuestDB write)
- **API response time**: &lt;200ms p95 for `/signals` endpoint
- **Availability**: 99.5% uptime target
- **Data retention**: 90 days in QuestDB (partitioned by day)
