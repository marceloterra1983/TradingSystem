## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Workspace API running on port 3200 (`backend/api/workspace`)

### Setup

```bash
cd frontend/apps/workspace
npm install
npm run dev   # http://localhost:3900
```

Workspace is available at `http://localhost:3900`. Use `npm run build` for optimized bundles and `npm run preview` to inspect the production build locally.

## Standalone Deployment

1. Build assets:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Serve `dist/` via static host (Nginx, Netlify, Vercel).
3. Configure reverse proxy to route API calls (`/api/workspace`) to backend service (`http://<api-host>:3200/api`).
4. Set environment variables during build (`VITE_WORKSPACE_API_URL=https://api.tradingsystem.local`).

## Dashboard Embed

- Dashboard proxies `/workspace` traffic through iframe pointing to standalone deployment.
- Ensure CORS headers on API allow dashboard origin (default `http://localhost:3103` in development).
- Keep Workspace build version pinned within dashboard deployment manifests.

## Production Pipeline

1. Install dependencies (`npm ci`).
2. Run quality gates: `npm run lint`, `npm run type-check`, `npm run test`.
3. Build assets: `npm run build`.
4. Upload `dist/` to CDN or static bucket.
5. Invalidate CDN cache to propagate new release.

## Automation

- Integrate with CI (GitHub Actions) to run lint/type-check/test/build.
- Artifacts attached to pipeline are deployed to hosting provider.
- Monitor build output size to maintain fast page loads (&lt;300 KB initial JS).

## Rollback

1. Restore previous `dist/` artifact from build cache.
2. Redeploy static assets to hosting provider.
3. If API changes deployed simultaneously, revert API to prior build to maintain contract.

## Post-Deployment Validation

- Load `https://<workspace-host>` and confirm login-free access.
- Verify `/api/items` requests succeed via browser dev tools (200 OK).
- Drag-and-drop between Kanban columns and ensure status persists on reload.
- Confirm dashboard iframe loads updated version without CSP violations.
