## Monitoring

- **Frontend availability**: Synthetic check hitting public Workspace URL every 5 minutes. Expect 200 OK and bundle checksum match.
- **Backend health**: Poll `GET http://<api-host>:3200/health` to confirm API connectivity (TimescaleDB + Express).
- **Dashboard embed**: After each release, verify iframe loads inside dashboard without CSP or proxy regressions.
- **Performance metrics**: Track LCP &lt;2s and INP &lt;200ms via browser performance monitor (beta).

## Logging

- Frontend emits user-facing toast notifications; console errors reserved for development builds.
- Backend (`backend/api/workspace`) writes structured JSON logs. Forward to central log aggregation if available.
- Optional telemetry (Sentry/New Relic) can be toggled alongside `VITE_ENABLE_ANALYTICS` when feature flag becomes available.

## Metrics

| KPI | Source | Target |
|-----|--------|--------|
| API availability | Workspace API `/health` | â‰¥99% |
| CRUD latency | `/api/items` response time | &lt;200ms p95 |
| Sync freshness | `lastSyncedAt` indicator | &lt;60s |
| Error rate | Failed API calls / total | &lt;1% |

## Maintenance Checklist

### Daily

- Confirm `/health` endpoint reports `status: ok`.
- Review backend logs for 4xx/5xx spikes.
- Perform quick drag-and-drop smoke test to ensure status persistence.

### Weekly

- Run `npm run lint`, `npm run type-check`, `npm run test` to catch regressions.
- Rotate stale ideas or archive completed items (&gt;90 days) to keep Kanban lean.
- Audit proxy configuration (`vite.config.ts`) after dependency upgrades.

### Monthly

- Run `npm outdated` and plan dependency upgrades.
- Capture bundle size report (`npm run build -- --report`) and compare to budget (&lt;300 KB initial JS).
- Review taxonomy (categories/priorities/statuses) with product stakeholders.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Checks | Resolution |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Blank screen | Browser console errors | Rebuild assets, verify environment variables |
| API 404/500 | Network tab for `/api/items` | Confirm backend `backend/api/workspace` running on 3200; check proxy |
| Drag-and-drop stuck | Network request fails | Inspect PUT `/api/items/:id` payload, restart API, retry |
| Dashboard iframe blocked | Frame-ancestors policy | Allow dashboard origin or host pre-flight check |

## Data Integrity

- Backend persists items to TimescaleDB schema `frontend_apps.workspace`.
- Coordinate with database team for nightly backups and retention policies.
- Keep API schema synchronized with frontend enums (status, priority, category).

## Alerting

- Alert when `/health` endpoint fails 3 consecutive times (critical severity).
- Warn when error rate exceeds 1% over 15 minutes.
- Notify on CDN/hosting incidents impacting static assets (deploy rollback may be required).
