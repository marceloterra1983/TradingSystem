## Summary

Workspace centralizes idea and feature management for the TradingSystem program. It delivers a standalone drag-and-drop experience with Kanban visualization while remaining fully accessible inside the main dashboard. Product and engineering teams capture ideas, categorize and prioritize work, and track delivery without switching tools.

**Technology Stack**

- React 18, TypeScript, Vite.
- Zustand for global state, TanStack Query for server state.
- Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, Lucide React icons, Framer Motion for UI.
- @dnd-kit for drag and drop interactions.
- Express API (port 3200) backed by TimescaleDB.

**Deployment Modes**

1. Standalone app on port 3900.
2. Embedded within Dashboard via iframe (`http://localhost:3103/#/workspace`).

## Stakeholders

- **Primary users**: Product managers, developers, project leads.
- **Operators**: DevOps (deployment, monitoring), backend team (API/database).
- **Downstream systems**: Dashboard embed, documentation references, Agno Agents (context queries).

## User Journeys

### Journey 1: Capture New Idea

1. User clicks the "+" button in the WorkspaceListSection header.
2. AddItemDialog opens.
3. User completes form (title, description, category, priority, tags).
4. Submission triggers POST `/api/items`.
5. Item appears in table and Kanban board under "New".
6. Success toast confirms creation.

### Journey 2: Track Implementation Progress

**Kanban Flow**:

1. Drag card from "New" to "In Progress".
2. PUT `/api/items/:id` updates status.
3. Card updates across board and table.
4. Status color reflects progress (purple for in-progress).

**Table Flow**:

1. Click "Edit" on the item row.
2. EditItemDialog opens with current values.
3. Change status to "In Progress".
4. Save triggers API update and UI refresh.

### Journey 3: Prioritize Backlog

1. View WorkspaceListSection table.
2. Identify priorities via color-coded badges.
3. Edit item to adjust priority (e.g., medium â†’ high).
4. Table and Kanban update badge color.
5. Team reviews high-priority items during planning.

### Journey 4: Filter and Search

1. Apply category filter (e.g., `gestao-riscos`).
2. Table and Kanban show filtered items.
3. Add tag filter (e.g., `urgent`) for refinement.
4. Prepare export or review (export feature planned).

### Journey 5: Dashboard Integration

1. Open Dashboard (`http://localhost:3103`).
2. Navigate to Workspace via sidebar.
3. Dashboard loads WorkspaceIframe embedding standalone app (`http://localhost:3900`).
4. Interact with full Workspace feature set.
5. Changes persist via shared backend API.

## SLA Metrics

- Page load time &lt;2 seconds.
- API response time &lt;200ms for CRUD.
- Drag and drop latency &lt;100ms.
- Availability target 99% (internal tool).
- Auto-save on every change with optimistic UI rollback.
