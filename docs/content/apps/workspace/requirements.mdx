## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Idea Registry

- Allow users to create, view, update, and delete workspace items.
- Required fields: `title`, `description`, `category`, `priority`; optional `tags`, `status`.
- Persist items via POST/PUT/DELETE requests to `/api/items`.
- Synchronize table view and Kanban board after each mutation.

### FR-2: Kanban Workflow

- Provide five drag-and-drop columns: `new`, `review`, `in-progress`, `completed`, `rejected`.
- Moving a card triggers PUT `/api/items/:id` with updated `status`.
- Show visual feedback during drag (overlay, highlight drop targets).
- Maintain column counts and badge colors aligned with status taxonomy.

### FR-3: Domain Taxonomy

- Support six categories (`documentacao`, `coleta-dados`, `banco-dados`, `analise-dados`, `gestao-riscos`, `dashboard`).
- Display category badges in table rows and Kanban cards.
- Surface category filter and ensure selections persist between sessions.

### FR-4: Prioritization

- Provide four priority levels (`low`, `medium`, `high`, `critical`) with color coding.
- Expose priority selector in create/edit dialogs.
- Reflect priority badge on cards and list rows.

### FR-5: Embedded Dashboard Mode

- Render inside dashboard iframe (`http://localhost:3103/#/workspace`) with full functionality.
- Honor dashboard theme sync (light/dark) and shared proxy routing (`/api/workspace` â†’ backend API).
- Prevent double scrollbars and ensure responsive layout in embedded viewport.

### FR-6: Feedback and Observability

- Show toast notifications for success and error outcomes.
- Display sync indicator tied to TanStack Query timestamps.
- Provide offline banner when backend API at `http://localhost:3200` is unreachable.

### FR-7: Filtering and Search

- Offer combined filters for category, status, priority, and tags.
- Keep filter chips visible above the table.
- Ensure filters apply to both table and Kanban data sources.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-1: Performance

- Page should become interactive in &lt;2 seconds on modern desktop hardware.
- API requests to `/api/items` should respond within 200ms p95.
- Drag-and-drop interactions should complete &lt;100ms after drop.
- Maintain acceptable UX with at least 10k items in list.

### NFR-2: Availability

- Target uptime: 99% (internal tool, business hours).
- Provide graceful fallback with retry banner when backend offline.
- Health monitored via `/health` endpoint on backend API.

### NFR-3: Security

- Ensure backend API remains internal; no anonymous public exposure.
- Avoid storing secrets on the client beyond proxy URL configuration.
- Sanitize all form inputs on client before POST/PUT requests.

### NFR-4: Usability

- UI must be usable without product training.
- Provide inline validation messaging and prevent empty required fields.
- Ensure keyboard focus states for dialogs and action buttons.

### NFR-5: Maintainability

- Maintain full TypeScript coverage for stores, hooks, and API payloads.
- Encapsulate state transitions inside `useWorkspaceStore`.
- Follow CollapsibleCard layout pattern for reusable sections.

### NFR-6: Observability

- Emit toast notifications for major actions (create, update, delete).
- Surface sync indicator showing last refresh time.
- Restrict console logging to development builds; production builds remain silent.
