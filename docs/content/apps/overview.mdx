## What lives here

Use this area to capture playbooks for TradingSystem applications such as Data Capture and Order
Manager. Every entry should contain:

- A concise summary of the scenario handled
- Required prerequisites or permissions
- A step-by-step resolution checklist with verification points
- Follow-up tasks and communication templates

## Drafting new playbooks

1. Create a new MDX file inside the relevant application folder.
2. Populate the mandatory frontmatter fields (`title`, `description`, `tags`, `owner`, `lastReviewed`).
3. Keep the directory structure consistentâ€”the sidebar auto-generates entries.
4. Request an SME review before marking the material production-ready.
