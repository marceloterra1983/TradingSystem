## Structure

Organize prompts by domain (`trading/`, `ops/`, `support/`) and document:

- Business objective and success criteria
- Input/output examples with expected tone
- Safety constraints and escalation rules
- Evaluation harness or regression suite references

## Maintenance

Track experiment results and link to recorded evaluations. When prompts change behavior, update the
linked PRD or SDD entries to maintain traceability.
