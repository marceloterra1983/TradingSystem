## Usage

- Store shared partials, reusable snippets, and MDX components until they move into `src/components/`.
- Keep templates under `_templates/` and provide guidance on when to copy vs. reference inline.
- Archive legacy diagrams or spec deltas in `_archive/` with clear provenance notes.

This area is optional in navigation; toggle visibility via `_category_.json` as needed when it
becomes crowded.
