## Overview

Security audits verify access control, configuration integrity, trading activity, data access, and
security events. TradingSystem establishes repeatable procedures for detecting issues, maintaining
compliance, and documenting findings.

## Audit Logging

### Application Logs

- **Format**: Structured JSON lines (`logs/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`).  
- **Retention**: 30 days online, 90 days archived.  
- **Levels**: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, `AUDIT`.  
- **Audit Events**: Logins, configuration changes, kill switch activations, order placements, risk violations.

Example:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-24T10:30:45.123Z",
  "level": "AUDIT",
  "service": "order-manager",
  "event": "order_placed",
  "user": "trader@company.com",
  "orderId": "ORD-20251024-001",
  "symbol": "PETR4",
  "quantity": 100,
  "price": 32.50,
  "riskChecks": {
    "dailyLossLimit": "passed",
    "positionSizeLimit": "passed",
    "tradingHours": "passed"
  },
  "ipAddress": "192.168.1.100",
  "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0..."
}
```

### Database Audit Tables (Planned)

```sql
CREATE TABLE audit_log (
  audit_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  event_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  user_id UUID,
  user_email TEXT,
  entity_type TEXT,
  entity_id UUID,
  action TEXT NOT NULL,
  old_value JSONB,
  new_value JSONB,
  ip_address INET,
  user_agent TEXT,
  result TEXT NOT NULL,
  error_message TEXT
);

CREATE INDEX idx_audit_log_timestamp ON audit_log(timestamp DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_log_user ON audit_log(user_id, timestamp DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_audit_log_event_type ON audit_log(event_type, timestamp DESC);
```

- **Retention**: One year minimum.  
- **Access**: Read-only for auditors; operators require explicit approval.

### Security Events

| Event | Severity | Retention | Alert |
|-------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Failed login | WARN | 90 days | After 5 failures |
| Successful login | INFO | 30 days | No |
| Password change | AUDIT | 1 year | Yes |
| Permission denial | WARN | 90 days | After 10 denials |
| Kill switch activated | AUDIT | 1 year | Critical |
| Risk limit changed | AUDIT | 1 year | Yes |
| Order rejected (risk) | WARN | 90 days | Threshold-based |
| Sensitive DB query | AUDIT | 90 days | No |
| Configuration change | AUDIT | 1 year | Yes |

## Access Control Audits

### User Access Review (Quarterly)

Checklist:

- [ ] Inventory users with production access (DB, admin UIs, servers).  
- [ ] Confirm role-based need for each user.  
- [ ] Remove access for inactive or departed staff.  
- [ ] Review API keys tied to users/services.  
- [ ] Document actions in audit log.

### API Key Audit (Monthly)

Steps:

1. List all keys from `.env`.  
2. Check last usage via logs or provider dashboards.  
3. Rotate keys older than 180 days.  
4. Revoke unused keys (&gt;90 days inactivity).  
5. Update documentation and confirm services still operate.  
6. Log changes in audit record.

## Configuration Audits

### Environment Variable Audit (Monthly)

Checklist:

- [ ] Run `bash scripts/env/validate-env.sh`.  
- [ ] Verify permissions (`ls -la .env`).  
- [ ] Review `.env.example` history (`git log .env.example`).  
- [ ] Ensure no secrets in Git (`git log -p | grep -i password`).  
- [ ] Compare production vs staging configs.  
- [ ] Document discrepancies.

### Risk Limit Audit (Weekly)

- Query `GET /api/risk/limits`.  
- Verify limits match approved policy.  
- Review Prometheus risk violation metrics.  
- Check kill switch status.  
- Log updates or anomalies.

## Trading Activity Audits

### Order Audit (Daily)

Steps:

1. Fetch orders placed today (`GET /api/orders?startDate=today`).  
2. Review large trades and unusual symbols.  
3. Confirm each order passed risk checks.  
4. Investigate rejected orders.  
5. Document anomalies and remediation.

### Position Reconciliation (Daily EOD)

1. Collect internal positions (`GET /api/risk/positions`).  
2. Compare with broker data.  
3. Investigate discrepancies above 1%.  
4. Adjust records or escalate.  
5. Log reconciliation outcome.

## Data Access Audits

### Database Query Review (Weekly)

- Inspect PostgreSQL logs for sensitive queries.  
- Confirm legitimate business purpose.  
- Highlight failed authentication attempts and slow queries.  
- Document suspicious activity.

### API Access Review (Weekly)

- Analyze API request volumes per client.  
- Monitor failed auth attempts and rate-limit violations.  
- Validate API keys against authorization list.  
- Record anomalies and corrective actions.

## Compliance Audits

### GDPR (Future Applicability) – Quarterly

- Catalog personal data storage locations.  
- Verify retention rules (e.g., 30 days post-deletion).  
- Track data subject access requests.  
- Ensure encryption at rest/in transit.  
- Summarize compliance posture.

### Financial Regulations (If Required) – Quarterly

- Confirm transaction logs retained 5–7 years.  
- Verify audit logs without gaps.  
- Evaluate risk controls (daily loss, position limits, kill switch).  
- Test kill switch functionality.  
- Report regulatory status.

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Procedure

1. **Detect** – Identify incident via alerts, logs, or user report.  
2. **Contain** – Isolate systems (disable accounts, block IPs).  
3. **Investigate** – Analyze audit logs, determine root cause.  
4. **Remediate** – Patch vulnerabilities, restore services.  
5. **Document** – Produce incident report, update runbooks.  
6. **Review** – Hold post-mortem and assign action items.
