## Support Policy

- **Supported Version**: Python 3.11 or higher.
- **Package Manager**: Poetry (preferred) or pip with virtual environments.
- **Upgrade Cadence**: Adopt new Python minor releases within six months.
- **EOL Policy**: Deprecate versions three months before the official Python EOL date.

## Use Cases in TradingSystem

- **Cause-and-Effect Modelling**: Analyse market pattern relationships.
- **Incremental Learning**: `SGDClassifier` with online updates.
- **Feature Engineering**: Aggressor flow, volatility, book delta, and volume anomalies.
- **Signal Generation**: BUY/SELL/HOLD with confidence scores.
- **Backtesting**: Replay historical data to validate strategies.
- **ML Toolkit**: scikit-learn, Polars, and NumPy.
- **Data Processing**: Parquet handling, time-series analysis, and arrow-based pipelines.

## Project Structure

- `backend/ml/` — Machine learning models and training pipelines.
- `backend/analytics/` — Data analysis and backtesting utilities.
- `scripts/` — Automation scripts (environment, validation, docs tooling).
- Dependencies managed via Poetry (`pyproject.toml`, `poetry.lock`) or pip (`requirements.txt`).
- Virtual environments are mandatory; never install globally.

## Development Workflow

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+, Poetry, and `python3-venv`.

### Setup Commands

```bash
# Install Poetry dependencies
cd backend/ml
poetry install

# Activate virtual environment
poetry shell

# Or use pip + venv
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Development Commands

```bash
# Run ML training
poetry run python train_model.py

# Run backtesting
poetry run python backtest.py --start-date 2025-01-01

# Run tests
poetry run pytest

# Lint code
poetry run ruff check .
poetry run black --check .
```

### Configuration

- Centralized `.env` stores shared secrets.
- Hyperparameters live in YAML config files.
- Data paths configured via environment variables.

## ML Model Development

1. **Data Ingestion**: Load historical tick data from Parquet files.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Compute aggressor flow, volatility, book delta, and volume anomalies.
3. **Model Training**: Train `SGDClassifier` with `partial_fit` for incremental updates.
4. **Validation**: Backtest on held-out datasets.
5. **Deployment**: Export models as ONNX or pickle artifacts.
6. **Monitoring**: Track accuracy, precision, recall, and drift indicators.

**Incremental Learning**:

- Use `SGDClassifier.partial_fit()` to update models with daily market data.
- Rebuild from scratch monthly to mitigate drift.

**Backtesting**:

- Replay historical data with time-travel simulation.
- Measure Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, and win rate.
- Produce reports with visual summaries.

## Hardware Acceleration

- RTX GPUs recommended for training workloads.
- Use CUDA-backed libraries (scikit-learn, PyTorch) when available.
- CPU-only mode remains supported for inference.
