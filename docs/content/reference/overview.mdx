## Contents

This directory captures immutable reference material generated from source-of-truth systems:

- Environment variables, ports, and service registry exports
- API surface area sourced from OpenAPI specs and Redoc pipelines
- Configuration schemas, CLI command guides, and integration matrices

When authoring a new reference page, provide sourcing details and automation hooks so the
`docs:auto` task can refresh content without manual steps.

## Automation pipeline hooks

Reference assets are expected to be regenerated by scripts in `scripts/docusaurus/` during Phase 3.
Document the corresponding command usage within each page so engineers know how to refresh data.
