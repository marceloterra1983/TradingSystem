## Template

> Use this template for operational runbooks and incident response procedures. Replace placeholder text with service-specific details.

### Metadata

- **Service**: [Service name - e.g., Order Manager API]
- **Owner**: [Team or person - e.g., Backend Guild]
- **Severity**: [P0 (Critical) | P1 (High) | P2 (Medium) | P3 (Low)]
- **Last Reviewed**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
- **On-Call**: [PagerDuty schedule or contact]

### Purpose

**Scope**: [What incidents this runbook covers]

**When to Use**: [Triggering conditions - e.g., "When Order Manager API returns 503 for &gt;5 minutes"]

### Preconditions

**Required Access**:

- [ ] [Access 1 - e.g., SSH access to production server]
- [ ] [Access 2 - e.g., Database admin credentials]
- [ ] [Access 3 - e.g., PagerDuty access]

**Required Tools**:

- [ ] [Tool 1 - e.g., kubectl CLI]
- [ ] [Tool 2 - e.g., Database client]

### Signals & Detection

**Alert Names**:

- `[AlertName1]` - [Description and threshold]
- `[AlertName2]` - [Description and threshold]

**Manual Detection**:

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:PORT/health

# Check logs
docker compose logs --tail=100 service-name
```

**Symptoms**:

- [Symptom 1 - e.g., Dashboard shows "API unavailable"]
- [Symptom 2 - e.g., Logs show connection errors]
- [Symptom 3 - e.g., Metrics show high error rate]

### Immediate Actions

**Quick Checklist** (execute in order):

1. [ ] Check service status: `docker compose ps service-name`
2. [ ] Review recent logs: `docker compose logs --tail=100 service-name`
3. [ ] Check resource usage: `docker stats service-name`
4. [ ] Verify dependencies: [Database, external APIs, etc.]
5. [ ] Attempt restart: `docker compose restart service-name`

### Detailed Procedure

#### Step 1: Triage

**Actions**:

1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]

**Commands**:

```bash
# Triage command 1
command

# Triage command 2
command
```

**Expected Results**: [What you should see]

#### Step 2: Mitigation

**Actions**:

1. [Mitigation action 1]
2. [Mitigation action 2]

**Commands**:

```bash
# Mitigation command
command
```

**Validation**: [How to confirm mitigation worked]

---

#### Step 3: Recovery

**Actions**:

1. [Recovery action 1]
2. [Recovery action 2]

**Validation**:

- [ ] [Check 1 - e.g., Service responds on port]
- [ ] [Check 2 - e.g., Health check returns 200 OK]
- [ ] [Check 3 - e.g., Dashboard shows data]

### Rollback Steps

**If Mitigation Fails**:

1. **Stop Current Deployment**:

   ```bash
   docker compose down service-name
   ```

2. **Restore Previous Version**:

   ```bash
   docker pull image:previous-tag
   docker compose up -d service-name
   ```

3. **Verify Rollback**:

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:PORT/health
   ```

### Post-Incident Validation

**Health Checks**:

- [ ] Service health endpoint returns 200 OK
- [ ] Logs show no errors for 5 minutes
- [ ] Metrics return to normal levels
- [ ] Dashboard functionality restored
- [ ] Dependent services operational

**Data Integrity**:

- [ ] No data loss during incident
- [ ] Recent transactions completed successfully
- [ ] Database consistency checks pass

### Post-Incident Tasks

**Within 1 Hour**:

- [ ] Notify stakeholders (all-clear message)
- [ ] Update incident ticket with resolution
- [ ] Document timeline and actions taken

**Within 24 Hours**:

- [ ] Create incident report
- [ ] Update this runbook if needed
- [ ] Schedule post-mortem meeting
- [ ] Identify preventive measures

**Within 1 Week**:

- [ ] Implement preventive measures
- [ ] Update monitoring/alerting
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Share lessons learned

### Contacts & Escalation

**Primary Contact**: [Name, Slack, Phone]

**Escalation Path**:

1. On-call engineer (immediate)
2. Team lead (if unresolved after 15 minutes)
3. Director (if critical and unresolved after 1 hour)

**Communication Channels**:

- Incident channel: #incidents
- Team channel: #team-name
- Status page: [URL]
