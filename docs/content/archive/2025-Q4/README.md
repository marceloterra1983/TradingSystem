# 2025 Q4 Archive

This folder is prepped for documentation that will be retired during the 2025 Q4 cycle. Mirror the original file paths when you move items here so we keep the historical breadcrumb trail intact.

## When You Archive
- Add `archived_date` and `archive_reason` to each document's frontmatter.
- Note the related maintenance ticket or audit report in the document body.
- Update navigation configs to remove the archived entry from active sidebars once the move is complete.

Document each archived item in the quarterly cleanup report under `docs/reports/` so the governance team can track activity for this period.
