## Coverage

This section hosts engineering deep dives, architectural diagrams, and onboarding guides for the
TradingSystem frontend teams. Organize content under subdirectories such as `architecture/`,
`components/`, `tooling/`, and `observability/`.

Each article should reference the owning squad, list the production contact path, and link to the
relevant repositories or dashboards.

## Authoring guidance

- Prefer mermaid or PlantUML diagrams stored adjacent to their source docs.
- Use callout components (coming in Phase 2.3) to highlight operational caveats.
- Cross-link to `apps` for dashboards or embedded experiences impacted by the work.
