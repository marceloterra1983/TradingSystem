## Executive Summary

**Trading App** is the unified product surface for TradingSystem, encompassing idea management (Workspace/Idea Bank), order execution (Order Manager), market data visualization (TP Capital signals), and risk controls. It provides traders and operators with a centralized dashboard for capturing ideas, executing orders with automated safeguards, monitoring positions, and tracking system health.

**Product Context**

TradingSystem is a complex platform with 6 independent systems:
1. **Dashboard** (Cyan) - UI/UX, KPIs, visualizations
2. **Data Collection** (Green) - ProfitDLL, WebSocket, feeds
3. **Database** (Purple) - Parquet, PostgreSQL, metadata
4. **Data Analysis** (Orange) - ML, features, backtesting
5. **Risk Management** (Red) - Orders, positions, limits
6. **Documentation** (Blue) - Docs, PRDs, ADRs

The Trading App serves as the primary interface for:
- Brainstorming and tracking feature ideas (Idea Bank)
- Executing orders with risk controls (Order Manager)
- Monitoring TP Capital signals (Signal Table)
- Visualizing positions and P&L (Dashboard)
- Managing system configuration (Connections)

**Positioning**

**For:** TradingSystem traders, operators, and developers  
**That:** Need to manage ideas, execute orders safely, and monitor trading activity  
**The Trading App is:** An integrated trading and operations platform  
**That:** Combines idea management, order execution, risk controls, and monitoring  
**Different from:** Generic trading platforms or project management tools  
**Our product:** Is purpose-built for TradingSystem with integrated risk controls, idea tracking, and multi-source signal aggregation

## Problem and Opportunity

**Current Challenges**
- Ideas scattered across notes, emails, and messages without systematic tracking
- Manual order execution prone to errors and lacking automated risk controls
- Multiple data sources (Workspace, TP Capital, B3) require manual correlation
- Lack of centralized monitoring and audit trail
- Difficulty prioritizing features and tracking implementation status

**Opportunity**
- Centralized idea management with categorization and prioritization
- Automated order execution with pre-trade risk checks
- Unified dashboard for signals, positions, and system health
- Complete audit trail for compliance and debugging
- Integrated workflow from idea capture to order execution

## Objectives and Success Criteria

**Primary Objectives**
1. Provide centralized idea management (Idea Bank/Workspace)
2. Enable safe automated order execution (Order Manager)
3. Visualize TP Capital signals and market data
4. Enforce risk controls (daily loss limits, position size, trading hours)
5. Monitor system health and performance

**Success Criteria**

**Quantitative**
- 100% of ideas registered in centralized system
- &lt;30 seconds to add new idea
- &lt;500ms p95 order placement latency
- 99% system uptime
- &lt;2 seconds dashboard page load time
- Support 10,000+ ideas without performance degradation

**Qualitative**
- Intuitive interface (no training required)
- Seamless integration across features
- Clear roadmap visibility through status board
- Transparent risk controls with actionable feedback
- Complete audit trail for compliance
