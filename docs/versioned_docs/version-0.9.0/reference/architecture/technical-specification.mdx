> ðŸš§ **Migration in progress.** This stub keeps existing references working while content is ported from the legacy documentation set.

- Legacy source: [technical-specification.md](https://github.com/marceloterra/TradingSystem/blob/main/docs_legacy/context/backend/architecture/technical-specification.md)
- Status: Tracked in docs Phase 6 migration plan

The fully migrated document will include the detailed technical requirements, diagrams, and review history for the backend architecture. Until then, refer to the legacy source above for authoritative guidance.
