## Overview

This catalogue lists all domain events emitted by TradingSystem v1. Events represent significant state changes or actions that downstream consumers can react to.

**Version**: v1  
**Status**: Specification (implementation pending)  
**Event Bus**: Kafka, RabbitMQ, or in-memory queue (TBD)

## Available Events

| Event | Description | Trigger | Consumers |
|-------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| [order.created](./order-created) | Order created and validated | POST /api/orders (success) | Dashboard, Audit, Analytics |
| order.submitted | Order sent to broker | Broker acknowledgment | Dashboard, Audit |
| order.filled | Order fully executed | Broker fill callback | Dashboard, Audit, Position Service |
| order.partially-filled | Order partially executed | Broker partial fill callback | Dashboard, Audit |
| [order.canceled](./order-canceled) | Order canceled | DELETE /api/orders (success) | Dashboard, Audit |
| [order.failed](./order-failed) | Submission retries exhausted | Broker/network failure after retries | Dashboard, Audit, Alerting |
| order.rejected | Order rejected | Risk check failure or broker rejection | Dashboard, Audit |
| risk.violation | Risk check failed | Risk validation failure | Dashboard, Audit, Alerting |
| kill-switch.activated | Kill switch activated | POST /api/risk/kill-switch | Dashboard, Audit, Alerting |

*Note: only `order.created` is fully documented in v1. Additional event specifications are planned.*

## Event Schema Conventions

```typescript
interface DomainEvent<T> {
  eventId: string;
  eventType: string;
  timestamp: string;
  version: string;
  payload: T;
  metadata: EventMetadata;
}

interface EventMetadata {
  traceId: string;
  userId?: string;
  source: string;
  correlationId?: string;
}
```

**Naming**

- Use dot notation `<entity>.<action>` (e.g., `order.created`, `risk.violation`)
- Use past tense for actions
- Use lowercase with dots

**Versioning**

- Include `version` field in event envelope (e.g., `"v1"`)
- Breaking changes require new version (e.g., `"v2"`)
- Maintain backward compatibility for 6 months

**Ordering**

- Events for same entity ordered by timestamp
- No ordering guarantee across different entities
- Consumers must handle out-of-order events

**Idempotency**

- Consumers must handle duplicate events
- Use `eventId` for deduplication
- At-least-once delivery semantics

## Event Publication

- Synchronous publication (blocking) for MVP
- Future: Async publication via outbox pattern for guaranteed delivery
- On failure, log error and continue (event may be lost)
- Event retention: 7 days on bus, 1 year in audit service
