## Expectations

Each SDD should answer the why, what, and how:

- Problems and success metrics
- Proposed solution with diagrams and data flows
- Alternatives considered and trade-offs
- Impact on infrastructure, security, and operations

Link to supporting PRDs, prototypes, and follow-up tasks. Archive superseded designs with clear
supersession references.
