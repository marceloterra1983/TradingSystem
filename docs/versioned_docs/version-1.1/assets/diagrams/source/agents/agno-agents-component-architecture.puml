note right of MarketAgent
  Consolida sinais TP Capital e contexto
  do Workspace para gerar recomendações.
end note

note right of RiskAgent
  Validates signals against daily limits,
  position sizing and trading hours.
end note

note right of OrchestratorAgent
  Coordinates workflow between agents and
  aggregates final responses.
end note

note bottom of Resilience
  Retry: exponential backoff (500ms, 1500ms, 3000ms)
  Circuit breaker: 5 failures, 60s timeout
end note
