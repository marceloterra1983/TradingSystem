## Support Policy

- **Supported Version**: .NET SDK 8.0 or higher.
- **Platform**: Windows 11 x64 (native execution for ProfitDLL integrations).
- **Upgrade Cadence**: Follow .NET LTS releases and move to a new LTS within six months.
- **EOL Policy**: Deprecate SDKs three months before Microsoft’s published EOL.

## Platform Requirements

- **Data Capture** (Port 3100): .NET 8 service that ingests market data from ProfitDLL.
- **Order Manager** (Port 3205): .NET 8 service for execution and risk controls.
- **ProfitDLL Integration**: Requires ProfitChart installed locally; Windows-only.
- **Why Native?** ProfitDLL is a Windows C++ library without Linux support, so services cannot be containerised.
- **Dual Platform**: .NET services run natively on Windows; Node.js APIs and tooling run in Linux/WSL environments.

## Project Structure

- **Solution File**: `TradingSystem.sln` at the repository root.
- **Service Layout**: `backend/services/data-capture/` and `backend/services/order-manager/` (proposed structure).
- **Architecture Layers**:
  1. Domain — Aggregates, Value Objects, Domain Events.
  2. Application — Use cases plus command/query handlers.
  3. Infrastructure — Repositories and ProfitDLL integrations.
  4. Presentation — Web API controllers and WebSocket handlers.

## Development Workflow

### Prerequisites

- Windows 11 x64, .NET SDK 8.0, ProfitChart installation, Nelogica Data Solution subscription.
- IDE: Visual Studio 2022 or JetBrains Rider.

### Commands

```bash
# Build solution
dotnet build TradingSystem.sln

# Build specific service
dotnet build backend/services/data-capture/DataCapture.csproj

# Run service
dotnet run --project backend/services/data-capture/DataCapture.csproj

# Run tests
dotnet test
```

### Configuration & Debugging

- Use the centralized `.env` for secrets and load via configuration providers.
- Service-specific settings stay in `appsettings.json` and `appsettings.Development.json`.
- ProfitDLL credentials flow through environment variables.
- Use Visual Studio debugging and attach to running processes when troubleshooting.
- Structured logs go to stdout for collection via systemd or external tooling.

## Integration with ProfitDLL

- **Capabilities**: Real-time ticks, order book streaming, historical retrieval, multi-asset orders, automatic reconnection.
- **Pattern**:
  1. Initialize ProfitDLL during service startup.
  2. Register callbacks for state, trade, book, and order events.
  3. Serialize native structs to JSON for downstream consumers.
  4. Publish to WebSockets or REST endpoints.
  5. Handle reconnection with exponential backoff.
- **Performance Targets**: Callback processing under 50 ms p95; order placement under 500 ms p95.
