> ðŸš§ **Migration in progress.** This stub prevents broken links while the backend service map is migrated from the legacy documentation set.

- Legacy source: [service-map.md](https://github.com/marceloterra/TradingSystem/blob/main/docs_legacy/context/backend/architecture/service-map.md)
- Status: Listed in the docs migration tracker

The final version will map every backend service, its responsibilities, and network ports. Use the legacy document linked above for the current canonical reference.
