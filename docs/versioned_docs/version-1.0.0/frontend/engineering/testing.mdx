## Tooling

- Vitest with React Testing Library for component and hook coverage.
- Playwright smoke flows are planned once dashboards stabilize.

## Expectations

- Cover utilities and Zustand stores with unit tests (`npm run test`).
- Add regression tests for Idea Bank and TP Capital journeys as features mature.
- Keep API mocks colocated under `__mocks__` for clarity.

## Commands

```bash
npm run test           # execute Vitest suites
npm run test:watch     # optional watch mode when configured
```
