## Commands

```bash
npm run lint       # ESLint validation (frontend apps provide wrapper scripts)
npm run lint:fix   # Auto-fix supported rules
npm run format     # Prettier formatting when available
```

## Guidelines

- Run linting before opening pull requests; CI enforces it.
- Add ESLint overrides sparingly and document the justification in the PR.
- Ensure generated docs remain lint clean by running `npm run docs:auto`.
