## Summary

Node.js 20 service that ingests TP Capital Telegram messages received by the **Telegram Gateway** and stores normalized signals in **TimescaleDB** (`APPS-TPCAPITAL.tp_capital_signals`). The API (`apps/tp-capital`, exposed on port **4005**) validates payloads, enriches metadata, exports Prometheus metrics, and serves the dashboard plus downstream automations via REST.

## Stakeholders

- **Primary users**: Dashboard UI consumers, Agno Agents (market analysis)
- **Operators**: Platform/DevOps team managing TimescaleDB, Telegram credentials, and Gateway configuration
- **Downstream systems**: Dashboard (port 3103), Agno Agents framework, data export jobs

## User Journeys

### Journey 1: Signal Ingestion

1. Telegram Gateway (port 4006) authenticates with MTProto and stores messages in `telegram_gateway.messages`.
2. TP Capital API polling worker fetches new rows, validates structure, and applies parsing rules (asset, buy range, targets, stop).
3. Service writes normalized payload to TimescaleDB (`tp_capital_signals`) and tracks processing metrics.
4. Gateway queue is marked as processed; API metrics reflect ingestion.

### Journey 2: Dashboard Consumption

1. Dashboard polls `/signals` endpoint every 15 seconds.
2. API queries TimescaleDB and returns paginated, filtered signals.
3. Dashboard renders tables/cards with sorting, filters, and freshness indicators.
4. Operators can trigger `/sync-messages` to backfill from Gateway if necessary.

### Journey 3: Agent Integration

1. Agno Agents query `/signals` (or `/forwarded-messages`) for latest events.
2. Combine signals with Workspace initiatives for enriched context.
3. Apply risk controls, alerting thresholds, and compliance checks.
4. Generate trading recommendations or trigger automation flows.

## SLA Metrics

- **Ingestion latency**: &lt;500ms p95 (Gateway write â†’ TimescaleDB commit)
- **API response time**: &lt;200ms p95 for `/signals`
- **Availability**: 99.5% uptime target
- **Data retention**: 90 days in TimescaleDB (monthly chunks, autovacuum enabled)
