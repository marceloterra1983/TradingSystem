## Summary

Service Launcher is a critical infrastructure service that provides orchestration and comprehensive health monitoring for the entire TradingSystem ecosystem. Built with Node.js 18+ and Express, it exposes HTTP APIs for launching services in new terminals (Windows/Linux), monitoring health status of all services, Docker containers, and databases, and providing aggregated metrics for dashboards and alerting systems.

**Technology Stack**

- Node.js 18+, Express 4.x
- Pino for structured logging
- Health check script integration (`scripts/maintenance/health-check-all.sh`)
- In-memory caching (60s TTL) for performance
- Rate limiting and CORS protection

**Port**: 3500 (default, configurable via `SERVICE_LAUNCHER_PORT`)

**Deployment**: Docker Compose (can run standalone for development)

## Stakeholders

- **Primary users**: Dashboard UI (ConnectionsPage, health indicators), DevOps team, monitoring systems (Prometheus)
- **Operators**: Platform/DevOps managing service lifecycle and health monitoring
- **Downstream systems**: Dashboard (port 3103), Grafana dashboards, alerting systems

## User Journeys

### Journey 1: Service Health Monitoring

1. Dashboard fetches `/api/status` every 30 seconds for real-time service status
2. Service Launcher queries all configured services (Workspace, TP Capital, Docs API, etc.)
3. Response includes overall status (ok/degraded/down), individual service status, latency metrics
4. Dashboard displays color-coded indicators (green/yellow/red) based on status

### Journey 2: Comprehensive Health Check

1. Operator or dashboard requests `/api/health/full` for complete system health
2. Service Launcher executes health check script (bash), returns cached result if fresh (&lt;60s)
3. Script checks: local services (node processes), Docker containers, databases (TimescaleDB, QuestDB)
4. Response includes detailed breakdown by category, overall health status, and remediation suggestions
5. Operator uses remediation steps to resolve any degraded components

### Journey 3: Service Launch (Terminal Orchestration)

1. Operator sends POST to `/launch` with service details (name, working directory, command)
2. Service Launcher detects OS (Windows/Linux) and launches service in new terminal
3. Windows: Uses Windows Terminal or PowerShell
4. Linux: Uses gnome-terminal, konsole, or xterm (fallback)
5. Service starts in isolated terminal for easy monitoring and log inspection

## Key Features

- **Multi-service health monitoring**: Queries 11+ services simultaneously with configurable timeouts
- **Comprehensive health checks**: Local services + Docker containers + databases in single API call
- **Smart caching**: 60s TTL for expensive health check operations, reduces load
- **Cross-platform terminal launch**: Windows Terminal, PowerShell, gnome-terminal support
- **Rate limiting**: 200 req/min default, protects against abuse
- **Structured logging**: JSON logs (production) or pretty print (development) via Pino
- **Metrics aggregation**: Average latency, service counts, degraded/down counters
- **Security**: CORS restricted to Dashboard + Docs origins, input validation

## Dependencies

- **Runtime**: Node.js 18+
- **Health Check Script**: `scripts/maintenance/health-check-all.sh` (must be executable)
- **Monitored Services**: Workspace (3200), TP Capital (4005), Docs API (3400), Dashboard (3103), Docusaurus (3205), and more
- **Docker**: For container health checks via `docker ps`, `docker stats`
- **Databases**: TimescaleDB (5432), QuestDB (9000) - optional, for health checks

## SLA Metrics

- **Availability**: 99.9% (critical infrastructure service)
- **Response Time**:
  - `/health`: &lt;50ms (own health check)
  - `/api/status`: &lt;3s (aggregates 11+ service checks)
  - `/api/health/full`: &lt;10ms (cached) or &lt;5s (fresh execution)
- **Uptime**: Must be running before Dashboard starts
- **Cache Hit Rate**: &gt;80% for `/api/health/full` (60s TTL optimization)
