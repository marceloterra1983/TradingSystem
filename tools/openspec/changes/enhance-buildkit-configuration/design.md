# BuildKit Configuration Enhancement Design

## Context

The project currently uses Docker BuildX with default BuildKit configuration, lacking optimization and proper isolation between development and production builds. This design document outlines the technical decisions and architecture for implementing a more robust BuildKit setup.

### Current State Analysis
- BuildKit v0.22.0 available only through Docker BuildX
- Default configuration without optimization
- No standalone BuildKit installation
- Missing dedicated production builder
- Invalid Docker plugins causing warnings

### Stakeholders
- **Development Team**: Needs faster builds and better debugging
- **DevOps Team**: Requires proper build isolation and monitoring
- **Security Team**: Needs hardened production builds
- **Infrastructure Team**: Wants better resource management

## Goals / Non-Goals

### Goals
- Install and configure standalone BuildKit for direct control
- Optimize build cache management and distribution
- Create dedicated production builder with security hardening
- Clean up and organize Docker plugins
- Implement build performance monitoring
- Update to latest stable BuildKit versions
- Configure proper resource limits and monitoring

### Non-Goals
- Replace Docker BuildX entirely (maintain compatibility)
- Create custom BuildKit forks or modifications
- Implement complex build orchestration systems
- Change existing Dockerfile structures
- Modify application deployment processes

## Decisions

### Decision: Install Standalone BuildKit
**Rationale**:
- Direct access to BuildKit features and configuration
- Better control over daemon settings
- Enhanced debugging capabilities
- Proper separation from Docker BuildX
- Future-proof for advanced features

**Alternatives considered**:
- Continue using only Docker BuildX: Less control and optimization
- Custom build solution: Too complex and unnecessary
- BuildKit in container: Adds unnecessary complexity
- Podman/Kaniko: Different ecosystem, steep learning curve

### Decision: Implement Distributed Cache Storage
**Rationale**:
- Faster builds through better cache utilization
- Shared cache between developers and CI/CD
- Better resource utilization
- Reduced bandwidth usage
- Improved build reproducibility

**Alternatives considered**:
- Local-only cache: Limited sharing capabilities
- S3/Object storage: Added complexity and cost
- Custom cache implementation: Unnecessary complexity
- No cache optimization: Poor performance

### Decision: Create Dedicated Production Builder
**Rationale**:
- Clear separation between dev and prod builds
- Enhanced security for production artifacts
- Better resource allocation
- Proper monitoring and alerting
- Clear audit trail for production builds

**Alternatives considered**:
- Single shared builder: Security concerns
- Container-based isolation: Added complexity
- Custom build pipeline: Too much maintenance
- Third-party builders: Vendor lock-in risk

### Decision: Implement Build Performance Monitoring
**Rationale**:
- Visibility into build performance
- Early detection of issues
- Resource usage optimization
- Better capacity planning
- Performance trend analysis

**Alternatives considered**:
- Basic logging only: Limited visibility
- Custom metrics solution: Unnecessary complexity
- Third-party monitoring: Added cost
- No monitoring: Poor observability

## Risks / Trade-offs

### Risk: Initial Performance Impact
**Mitigation**:
- Gradual rollout of changes
- Performance benchmarking before/after
- Easy rollback procedure
- Clear documentation for optimization

### Risk: Learning Curve for Teams
**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive documentation
- Team training sessions
- Gradual feature introduction
- Support during transition

### Trade-off: Configuration Complexity vs Control
- **Balance**: Implement advanced features with good defaults
- **Documentation**: Clear guidelines for customization
- **Automation**: Scripts for common tasks
- **Monitoring**: Track usage patterns

### Risk: Cache Management Overhead
**Mitigation**:
- Automated cache cleanup
- Clear cache policies
- Monitoring and alerts
- Regular maintenance scripts

## Performance Targets

### Build Performance
- **Cache hit ratio**: >80%
- **Build time reduction**: 40%
- **Resource utilization**: <70% peak
