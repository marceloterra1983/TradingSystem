# Reinstall BuildKit Build System

## Why

The existing BuildKit migration proposal (`migrate-to-buildkit`) was created but never fully implemented, and the current BuildKit installation shows signs of corruption and misconfiguration. The system needs a complete reinstallation to restore proper BuildKit functionality and enable the optimized build capabilities outlined in the original migration plan.

Key problems with current BuildKit state:
- **Builder corruption**: `desktop-linux` builder shows "protocol not available" errors
- **Incomplete migration**: Previous migration proposal exists but was not implemented
- **Configuration drift**: BuildKit configurations may be inconsistent across services
- **Cache issues**: Potential cache corruption from partial implementation attempts
- **Builder conflicts**: Multiple builder configurations causing conflicts

A complete reinstallation will ensure clean state, proper configuration, and enable the full benefits of BuildKit for the TradingSystem microservices architecture.

## What Changes

- **Complete BuildKit reinstallation** with clean configuration and builder setup
- **Builder configuration cleanup** removing corrupted or conflicting builders
- **Cache system reset** to eliminate potential cache corruption issues
- **Docker Desktop integration fix** to resolve desktop-linux builder errors
- **Fresh builder creation** with optimized settings for the project needs
- **Configuration validation** to ensure BuildKit works across all development environments
- **Fallback mechanisms** to prevent build system disruption during reinstallation
- **Documentation update** reflecting the reinstallation process and current state

## Impact

- **Affected specs**: Leverages existing `build-optimization` capability from migrate-to-buildkit
- **Affected code**:
  - Docker BuildX builder configurations
  - BuildKit cache storage locations
  - Docker Desktop BuildKit integration settings
  - CI/CD pipeline BuildKit configurations (if any exist)
  - Development environment BuildKit setup

- **Build System Restoration**:
  - Clean BuildKit installation with proper builder configuration
  - Fixed desktop-linux builder integration
  - Optimized cache management with clean state
  - Multi-platform support readiness (linux/amd64, linux/arm64)

- **Developer Experience**:
  - Reliable BuildKit functionality across development environments
  - Consistent builder behavior and performance
  - Clean cache state for predictable build times
  - Proper integration with Docker Desktop and IDE tooling

- **Risk Mitigation**:
  - Backup of existing configurations before reinstallation
  - Rollback procedures if reinstallation encounters issues
  - Validation steps to ensure functionality after reinstallation
  - Minimal disruption to existing development workflows

- **Breaking changes**: None (reinstallation only, no functional changes)
- **Migration path**: Clean reinstallation with validation testing
