## Unexpected Positive Outcomes

1. **BuildKit Version Upgrade**: Multiplatform builder runs BuildKit v0.25.1 (newer than original v0.22.0)
2. **Faster Completion**: Total time was ~10 minutes instead of planned 2 hours
3. **Better Performance**: docker-container driver provides better isolation and features
4. **Clean State**: Complete clean slate with no legacy configuration issues
5. **Multiple Options**: Now have multiple builders for different use cases

## Validation Gates Status

- âœ… **Gate 1**: Pre-Reinstallation Validation - PASSED
- âœ… **Gate 2**: Post-Cleanup Validation - PASSED
- âœ… **Gate 3**: Post-Installation Validation - PASSED
- âœ… **Gate 4**: Final Validation - PASSED

## Risk Mitigation Status

- âœ… **Build System Downtime**: Minimal (<15 minutes actual vs planned)
- âœ… **Configuration Corruption**: Complete backup created
- âœ… **Docker Desktop Issues**: No issues encountered
- âœ… **Cache Loss Impact**: Cache cleaned but functionality verified

## Success Metrics
