# BuildKit Migration Design Document

## Context

The TradingSystem project has evolved into a complex microservices architecture with 15+ services spanning Node.js APIs, Python AI tools, React frontends, and monitoring infrastructure. The current Docker build system uses legacy builders with basic layer caching, resulting in slow builds and inconsistent optimization patterns.

### Current State Analysis
- **Build Performance**: Average build time 8-12 minutes per service
- **Image Sizes**: Production images ranging from 200MB to 1.2GB
- **Cache Efficiency**: Minimal layer caching between builds
- **Build Patterns**: Inconsistent Dockerfile optimizations across services
- **Platform Support**: Limited to linux/amd64 only

### Stakeholders
- **Development Teams**: Need faster local build cycles and consistent environments
- **DevOps Team**: Requires efficient CI/CD pipelines and cache management
- **Security Team**: Needs minimal attack surfaces and secure build practices
- **Infrastructure Team**: Wants multi-platform support for future flexibility

## Goals / Non-Goals

### Goals
- Reduce build times by 70% through effective caching and parallelization
- Minimize production image sizes by 50% with multi-stage builds
- Enable multi-platform builds (linux/amd64, linux/arm64) for future infrastructure
- Standardize build patterns across all service types
- Implement secure build practices with non-root users and minimal base images
- Create developer-friendly build orchestration with caching optimization
- Enable efficient CI/CD pipelines with registry-based caching

### Non-Goals
- Change application architecture or runtime behavior
- Implement entirely new containerization approaches (e.g., Podman)
- Create custom base images (use official images when possible)
- Migrate away from Docker ecosystem
- Implement complex build matrix testing (basic multi-platform only)

## Decisions

### Decision: BuildKit with Docker BuildX as Primary Build Engine
**Rationale**:
- Native integration with existing Docker ecosystem
- Advanced caching capabilities with registry storage
- Multi-platform support for future infrastructure flexibility
- Parallel build processing for complex microservices
- Well-documented and battle-tested in production

**Alternatives considered**:
- Kaniko: Google-native but requires Kubernetes integration
- Buildah: Podman ecosystem, requires tooling migration
- Bazel: Powerful but complex learning curve
- Source-to-Image (S2I): Limited to specific platforms

### Decision: Registry-Based Cache Management
**Rationale**:
- Shared cache between local development and CI/CD
- Persistent storage across build environments
- Efficient bandwidth utilization with layer deduplication
- Support for remote team collaboration
- Easy cache invalidation and management

**Alternatives considered**:
- Local cache only: Limited sharing between environments
- File-based cache: Complex synchronization and management
- In-memory cache: Not persistent across builds
- No cache: Worst performance but simplest setup

### Decision: Multi-Stage Build Templates by Service Type
**Rationale**:
- Optimized patterns for different technology stacks
- Consistent security and performance optimizations
- Reduced duplication across similar services
- Easy maintenance and updates
- Clear separation of build and runtime dependencies

**Service Types Identified**:
- Node.js APIs (Express, Fastify)
- React/Vite Frontends
- Python AI/ML Services
- Data Processing Services
- Monitoring and Observability Tools

### Decision: Make-Based Build Orchestration
**Rationale**:
- Familiar interface for developers
- Easy integration with existing tooling
- Parallel build support with dependency management
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Simple debugging and logging

**Alternatives considered**:
- Bash scripts: Simpler but harder to maintain
- Task runners (npm scripts, just): Limited to specific ecosystems
- CI/CD only: Poor local development experience
- Docker Compose build: Limited customization options

### Decision: Separate Development and Production Build Targets
**Rationale**:
- Optimized for different use cases (fast iteration vs minimal size)
- Development builds with hot reload and debugging tools
- Production builds with security hardening and minimal footprint
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier testing and validation

## Risks / Trade-offs

### Risk: Build Complexity Increase
**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive documentation and examples
- Make-based orchestration for simple interface
- Progressive migration with fallback options
- Team training and knowledge sharing

### Risk: Cache Management Overhead
**Mitigation**:
- Automated cache cleanup policies
- Monitoring and alerting for cache size
- Documentation for cache management practices
- Tools for cache analysis and optimization

### Trade-off: Build Time vs Image Size
- **Balance approach**: Optimize for both with configurable parameters
- **Development builds**: Prioritize speed over size
- **Production builds**: Prioritize size and security over speed
- **Configurable options**: Allow customization per project needs

### Risk: Multi-Platform Build Complexity
**Mitigation**:
- Start with amd64 optimization first
- Add arm64 support incrementally
- Use emulation for testing cross-platform builds
- Clear documentation for platform-specific considerations

### Risk: Migration Disruption
**Mitigation**:
- Incremental migration service by service
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- Comprehensive testing before each migration
- Rollback procedures and recovery plans
