# Documentation Versioning - Implementation Tasks

## Overview

This checklist tracks the implementation of documentation versioning for TradingSystem. Tasks are organized by phase with dependencies clearly marked.

**Timeline**: 4 phases over 3-4 weeks (Nov 7 - Nov 30, 2025)
**Owner**: DocsOps + Release Manager
**Priority**: HIGH - Required before Phase 6 cut-over (Nov 15)

---

## Phase 1: Preparation & Configuration (Nov 7-10)

**Goal**: Configure Docusaurus for versioning and test locally
**Duration**: 2 days
**Blocker**: Must complete before Phase 6 launch

### 1.1 Docusaurus Configuration

- [ ] 1.1.1 Update `docs/docusaurus.config.js` with versions preset
  - [ ] Add `lastVersion: 'current'` to docs config
  - [ ] Add `versions` object with `current` label configuration
  - [ ] Add `onlyIncludeVersions` conditional for dev mode
  - [ ] Configure banner settings per version type
  - File: `docs/docusaurus.config.js:30-36`

- [ ] 1.1.2 Add version dropdown to navbar
  - [ ] Add `docsVersionDropdown` item to navbar
  - [ ] Configure position: right
  - [ ] Add separator and "All Releases" link in dropdown
  - File: `docs/docusaurus.config.js:144-191`

- [ ] 1.1.3 Update package.json scripts
  - [ ] Add `docs:version` script
  - [ ] Add `docs:version:create` script with variable
  - [ ] Add `docs:version:list` script
  - [ ] Add `docs:build:fast` script for dev builds
  - File: `docs/package.json:8-22`

### 1.2 Local Testing

- [ ] 1.2.1 Create test version (0.9.0)
  ```bash
  cd docs
  npx docusaurus docs:version 0.9.0
  ```

- [ ] 1.2.2 Verify files created
  - [ ] Check `versions.json` contains `["0.9.0"]`
  - [ ] Verify `versioned_docs/version-0.9.0/` exists
  - [ ] Count files: `find versioned_docs/version-0.9.0/ -name "*.mdx" | wc -l` (expect 135)
  - [ ] Check `versioned_sidebars/version-0.9.0-sidebars.json` exists

- [ ] 1.2.3 Test dev server
  ```bash
  npm run docs:dev
  ```
  - [ ] Version dropdown appears in navbar
  - [ ] Dropdown shows "Next (Unreleased)" and "0.9.0"
  - [ ] Clicking "0.9.0" navigates to `/` (root path)
  - [ ] Clicking "Next" navigates to `/next/`
  - [ ] Banner shows on "Next" version (unreleased warning)

- [ ] 1.2.4 Test build performance
  ```bash
  npm run docs:build
  ```
  - [ ] Build completes successfully
  - [ ] Record build time (expect ~75s)
  - [ ] Check `build/` directory structure
  - [ ] Verify both versions built (check `build/next/` and `build/` paths)

  ```bash
  NODE_ENV=development npm run docs:build
  ```

  - [ ] External links valid
  - [ ] Cross-version links resolve correctly
  - [ ] Report < 5 broken links total

### 1.4 Cleanup Test Version

- [ ] 1.4.1 Remove test version
  ```bash
  rm -rf versioned_docs/version-0.9.0
  rm versioned_sidebars/version-0.9.0-sidebars.json
  # Edit versions.json to remove "0.9.0"
  ```

- [ ] 1.4.2 Commit configuration changes

## Rollback Procedures

### If Version 1.0.0 Creation Fails

1. **Remove version entry**:
   ```bash
   # Edit versions.json - remove "1.0.0"
   ```

2. **Delete version files**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf versioned_docs/version-1.0.0
   rm versioned_sidebars/version-1.0.0-sidebars.json
   ```

3. **Commit rollback**:
   ```bash
   git add versions.json versioned_docs/ versioned_sidebars/
   git commit -m "revert: rollback version 1.0.0 creation"
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Investigate and fix validation failures**

5. **Retry version creation**

### If Build Performance Degrades

1. **Short-term**: Archive oldest version
2. **Medium-term**: Enable dev mode in CI (`onlyIncludeVersions`)
3. **Long-term**: Deprecate versions > 2 years

---

## Success Criteria

### Must Have (Phase 1-2)
- [x] Docusaurus versioning configured
- [ ] Version 1.0.0 created successfully
- [ ] Version dropdown functional in UI
- [ ] All validations pass with versioning enabled
- [ ] Build time < 90s with 2 versions

### Should Have (Phase 3)
- [ ] Governance docs updated with versioning procedures
- [ ] Versioning guide created and approved
- [ ] Stakeholders trained on versioning workflow

### Nice to Have (Phase 4)
- [ ] CI/CD workflow automated
- [ ] Monitoring dashboard operational
- [ ] Retention policy enforced

---

## Risk Register

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|------|------------|--------|------------|--------|
| Version creation fails during launch | Medium | High | Test thoroughly in Phase 1, have rollback ready | Mitigated |
| Build time exceeds 120s | Low | Medium | Monitor, optimize, enforce retention policy | Monitored |
| Users confused by versions | Medium | Low | Clear labels, banners, documentation | Mitigated |
| Broken links in old versions | High | Low | Accept as "point in time", document in known issues | Accepted |
| Security fix needed in old version | Low | High | Exception to no-backports policy, document procedure | Mitigated |

---

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- None (Docusaurus v3 already installed)

### Internal Dependencies
- Phase 6 cut-over completion (for v1.0.0 timing)
- Stakeholder approvals (DocsOps, Release Manager, Architecture Guild)
- CI/CD pipeline access (for Phase 4 automation)

---

## Team Assignments

| Phase | Owner | Backup | Stakeholders |
|-------|-------|--------|--------------|
| Phase 1: Configuration | DocsOps | Frontend Guild | Architecture Guild |
| Phase 2: First Version | Release Manager | DocsOps | All stakeholders |
| Phase 3: Governance | DocsOps | ProductOps | Architecture Guild, Release Manager |
