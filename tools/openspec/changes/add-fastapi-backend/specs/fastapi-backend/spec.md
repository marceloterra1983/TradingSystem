## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: FastAPI Backend Framework Support
The system SHALL support FastAPI as a primary backend framework for Python-native microservices alongside existing Node.js/Express services.

#### Scenario: FastAPI service creation
- **WHEN** a developer creates a new microservice requiring Python/ML integration
- **THEN** the system SHALL provide FastAPI templates and scaffolding tools
- **AND** the service SHALL automatically generate OpenAPI documentation
- **AND** the service SHALL follow established port allocation (4100-4199 range)

#### Scenario: Async API performance
- **WHEN** a FastAPI service handles concurrent requests
- **THEN** the system SHALL provide async/await support for I/O operations
- **AND** SHALL deliver superior performance for data-intensive operations
- **AND** SHALL maintain connection pooling for database access

#### Scenario: ML model integration
- **WHEN** implementing ML inference endpoints
- **THEN** FastAPI SHALL provide native Python object serialization
- **AND** SHALL eliminate Python-to-Node.js serialization overhead
- **AND** SHALL support async model loading and inference

### Requirement: Dual Framework Architecture
The system SHALL maintain both Express.js and FastAPI as supported backend frameworks with clear selection guidelines.

#### Scenario: Framework selection
- **WHEN** creating a new microservice
- **THEN** developers SHALL have clear guidelines for Express vs FastAPI selection
- **AND** SHALL consult the decision matrix based on service requirements
- **AND** SHALL choose the framework that provides optimal performance and maintainability

#### Scenario: Service interoperability
- **WHEN** Express and FastAPI services communicate
- **THEN** both SHALL use consistent API contracts and error handling
- **AND** SHALL support the same authentication and authorization patterns
- **AND** SHALL provide compatible health check endpoints

### Requirement: FastAPI Development Tooling
The system SHALL provide comprehensive development tools and patterns for FastAPI services.

#### Scenario: Local development
- **WHEN** developing FastAPI services locally
- **THEN** developers SHALL use hot reload with uvicorn
- **AND** SHALL have automatic type checking with mypy
- **AND** SHALL use standardized logging configuration

#### Scenario: Testing and quality
- **WHEN** writing tests for FastAPI services
- **THEN** the system SHALL provide pytest-asyncio templates
- **AND** SHALL include automatic API contract testing
- **AND** SHALL support load testing with locust integration

### Requirement: FastAPI Deployment Integration
FastAPI services SHALL integrate seamlessly with existing Docker Compose and deployment infrastructure.

#### Scenario: Container deployment
- **WHEN** deploying FastAPI services
- **THEN** the system SHALL provide optimized Docker base images
- **AND** SHALL support multi-stage builds for production
- **AND** SHALL integrate with existing service discovery patterns

#### Scenario: Monitoring and observability
- **WHEN** FastAPI services run in production
- **THEN** they SHALL expose Prometheus metrics endpoints
- **AND** SHALL use structured logging compatible with existing patterns
- **AND** SHALL support distributed tracing with existing tools

### Requirement: Performance and Documentation
FastAPI services SHALL provide superior performance and automatic API documentation.

#### Scenario: API documentation
- **WHEN** FastAPI services are deployed
- **THEN** they SHALL automatically generate Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
- **AND** SHALL provide interactive API exploration interfaces
- **AND** SHALL include example requests and responses

#### Scenario: High-throughput operations
- **WHEN** processing high-volume data operations
- **THEN** FastAPI services SHALL handle concurrent requests efficiently
- **AND** SHALL provide connection pooling for database operations
- **AND** SHALL support streaming responses for large data sets
