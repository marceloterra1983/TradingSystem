## Why
Introduce FastAPI as an alternative backend framework to provide high-performance async APIs, automatic OpenAPI documentation, type safety, and Python ecosystem integration for ML-focused services.

## What Changes
- Add FastAPI as a supported backend framework alongside existing Node.js/Express services
- Create new FastAPI service templates and development patterns
- **BREAKING**: Establish Python 3.11+ as additional requirement for FastAPI services
- Add FastAPI-specific development tooling and deployment configurations
- Create migration guides for services that benefit from Python/ML integration

## Impact
- Affected specs: New `fastapi-backend` capability, potential updates to `analytics-pipeline`, `ml-services`
- Affected code: `infrastructure/`, `backend/services/`, development tooling
- New service ports: 4100-4199 range reserved for FastAPI services
- Documentation updates for dual-framework architecture
