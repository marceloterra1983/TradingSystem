## Section goals

- Centralize PRDs and launch briefs so stakeholders can trace decisions.
- Provide canonical templates for new artifacts and link them with relevant design reviews.
- Surface acceptance criteria, SLAs, and telemetry requirements that downstream teams depend on.

## Template checklist

Every artifact in this directory should include:

- Up-to-date metadata (status, reviewers, target release)
- Linkage to related epics or tickets
- OpenSpec deltas when new capabilities or policies are introduced

Use `_templates/` for canonical files and keep archived documents under `_archive/` to maintain signal.
