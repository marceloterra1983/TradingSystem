# Contributors guide:

Welcome to [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev) ðŸ”¥! Here are some instructions on how to get the project locally, so you can run it on your own (and contribute)

If you're contributing, note that the process is similar to other open source repos i.e. (fork firecrawl, make changes, run tests, PR). If you have any questions, and would like help getting on board, reach out to help@firecrawl.com for more or submit an issue!

## Running the project locally

First, start by installing dependencies:

1. node.js [instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs)
2. rust [instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
3. pnpm [instructions](https://pnpm.io/installation)
4. redis [instructions](https://redis.io/docs/latest/operate/oss_and_stack/install/install-redis/)
5. postgresql
6. Docker (optional) (for running postgres)

You need to set up the PostgreSQL database by running the SQL file at `apps/nuq-postgres/nuq.sql`. Easiest way is to use the docker image inside `apps/nuq-postgres`. With Docker running, build the image:

```bash
docker build -t nuq-postgres .
```

and then run:

```bash
docker run --name nuqdb \          
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
  -p 5433:5432 \
  -v nuq-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -d nuq-postgres
```

Set environment variables in a .env in the /apps/api/ directory you can copy over the template in .env.example.

To start, we won't set up authentication, or any optional sub services (pdf parsing, JS blocking support, AI features)

.env:

```
# ===== Required ENVS ======
NUM_WORKERS_PER_QUEUE=8
PORT=3002
HOST=0.0.0.0
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
REDIS_RATE_LIMIT_URL=redis://localhost:6379

## To turn on DB authentication, you need to set up supabase.
USE_DB_AUTHENTICATION=false

## Using the PostgreSQL for queuing -- change if credentials, host, or DB is different
NUQ_DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5433/postgres

# ===== Optional ENVS ======

# Supabase Setup (used to support DB authentication, advanced logging, etc.)
SUPABASE_ANON_TOKEN=
SUPABASE_URL=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_TOKEN=

# Other Optionals
TEST_API_KEY= # use if you've set up authentication and want to test with a real API key
OPENAI_API_KEY= # add for LLM dependednt features (image alt generation, etc.)
BULL_AUTH_KEY= @
PLAYWRIGHT_MICROSERVICE_URL=  # set if you'd like to run a playwright fallback
LLAMAPARSE_API_KEY= #Set if you have a llamaparse key you'd like to use to parse pdfs
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL= # set if you'd like to send slack server health status messages
POSTHOG_API_KEY= # set if you'd like to send posthog events like job logs
POSTHOG_HOST= # set if you'd like to send posthog events like job logs


```

### Installing dependencies

First, install the dependencies using pnpm.

```bash
# cd apps/api # to make sure you're in the right folder
pnpm install # make sure you have pnpm version 9+!
```

### Running the project

You're going to need to open 3 terminals.

### Terminal 1 - setting up redis

Run the command anywhere within your project

```bash
redis-server
```

### Terminal 2 - setting up the service

Now, navigate to the apps/api/ directory and run:

```bash
pnpm start
# if you are going to use the [llm-extract feature](https://github.com/firecrawl/firecrawl/pull/586/), you should also export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-______
```

This will start the workers who are responsible for processing crawl jobs.

### Terminal 3 - sending our first request.

Alright: now letâ€™s send our first request.

```curl
curl -X GET http://localhost:3002/test
```

This should return the response Hello, world!

If youâ€™d like to test the crawl endpoint, you can run this

```curl
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/v1/crawl \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
      "url": "https://mendable.ai"
    }'
```

### Alternative: Using Docker Compose

For a simpler setup, you can use Docker Compose to run all services:

1. Prerequisites: Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed
2. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` in the `/apps/api/` directory and configure as needed
3. From the root directory, run:

```bash
docker compose up
```

This will start Redis, the API server, and workers automatically in the correct configuration.

## Tests:

The best way to do this is run the test with `npm run test:snips`.
