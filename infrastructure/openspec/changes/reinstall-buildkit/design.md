# BuildKit Reinstallation Design Document

## Context

The TradingSystem project has an existing BuildKit migration proposal (`migrate-to-buildkit`) that was created but never fully implemented. Current BuildKit installation shows signs of corruption with the `desktop-linux` builder reporting "protocol not available" errors, indicating configuration issues that require a complete reinstallation.

### Current State Analysis
- **BuildKit Version**: BuildX v0.11.2 is installed but partially functional
- **Builder Status**: `default` builder works but `desktop-linux` builder is corrupted
- **Previous Work**: Comprehensive migration proposal exists but implementation incomplete
- **Cache State**: Unknown potential cache corruption from previous attempts
- **Configuration**: Inconsistent BuildKit configuration across development environments

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Incomplete Migration**: Previous migration attempt left BuildKit in partial state
- **Docker Desktop Issues**: Desktop integration problems causing builder corruption
- **Configuration Drift**: BuildKit settings may be inconsistent or corrupted
- **Cache Contamination**: Previous failed attempts may have corrupted cache storage

## Goals / Non-Goals

### Goals
- Restore BuildKit to clean, fully functional state
- Fix desktop-linux builder integration issues
- Enable proper BuildKit functionality for future optimization implementation
- Provide reliable build system foundation for the microservices architecture
- Ensure consistent BuildKit behavior across development environments
- Clean up any corrupted cache or configuration remnants

### Non-Goals
- Implement the full BuildKit migration (that's covered by migrate-to-buildkit proposal)
- Change Docker Desktop configuration or installation
- Modify existing Dockerfiles or build processes (yet)
- Create new build capabilities or optimizations
- Implement CI/CD pipeline changes

## Decisions

### Decision: Complete Reinstallation Over Repair

**Rationale**:
- Corruption issues suggest fundamental configuration problems
- Reinstallation provides clean state eliminating unknown variables
- Faster and more reliable than attempting to debug complex configuration issues
- Ensures consistent baseline for future optimization work
- Removes potential cache corruption from previous failed attempts

**Alternatives considered**:
- Repair existing installation: Complex with unknown success rate
- Selective builder rebuild: May not address underlying configuration issues
- Cache-only cleanup: Insufficient given builder corruption extent

### Decision: Backup Before Reinstallation

**Rationale**:
- Preserve any working configurations that might be useful
- Enable rollback if reinstallation encounters unexpected issues
- Document current state for comparison and validation
- Maintain continuity for development team workflows

**Backup scope**:
- Current BuildX builder configurations
- BuildKit cache storage location
- Docker Desktop BuildKit settings
- Any custom BuildKit configuration files

### Decision: Validation-First Approach

**Rationale**:
- Ensure reinstallation actually resolves the identified issues
- Validate functionality before declaring success
- Provide confidence that BuildKit is ready for optimization work
- Create baseline metrics for future performance comparison

**Validation criteria**:
- All builders functional without errors
- BuildKit cache working correctly
- Multi-platform build capability confirmed
- Integration with development tools verified

## Reinstallation Strategy

### Phase 1: Assessment and Backup (Immediate)
1. Document current BuildKit/BuildX configuration
2. Backup existing builder settings and cache locations
3. Identify all BuildKit-related configurations and files
4. Test current BuildKit functionality for baseline comparison
5. Document any working configurations or customizations

### Phase 2: Cleanup and Removal (First 30 minutes)
1. Stop all BuildKit builders and processes
2. Remove existing BuildX builders completely
3. Clean BuildKit cache storage locations
4. Remove BuildKit configuration files
5. Restart Docker daemon to ensure clean state

### Phase 3: Fresh Installation (Next 30 minutes)
1. Verify BuildKit is enabled in Docker daemon
2. Create new default builder with optimal settings
3. Configure desktop-linux builder properly
4. Set up cache storage with appropriate settings
5. Test basic BuildKit functionality

### Phase 4: Validation and Testing (Final 30 minutes)
1. Test all builders are functional
2. Verify multi-platform build capability
3. Test cache operations work correctly
4. Validate integration with development tools
5. Confirm reinstallation resolved original issues

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Risk: Build System Unavailability During Reinstallation
**Mitigation**:
- Schedule reinstallation during low-activity periods
- Communicate timing to development team
- Have fallback plan ready (legacy Docker builder)
- Complete reinstallation quickly (under 2 hours total)

### Risk: Docker Desktop Integration Issues
**Mitigation**:
- Document Docker Desktop settings before changes
- Test Docker Desktop functionality after reinstallation
- Have Docker Desktop reinstallation procedure ready
- Provide clear troubleshooting steps for common issues

### Risk: Cache Loss Affecting Development Workflows
**Mitigation**:
- Backup existing cache before removal
- Communicate temporary cache loss to team
- Plan cache warming for critical services
- Document expected build time increase after reinstallation

### Risk: Configuration Differences Across Environments
**Mitigation**:
- Document reinstallation process for replication
- Create environment-specific configuration guides
- Test reinstallation on different development setups
- Provide troubleshooting steps for environment-specific issues

## Technical Implementation Details

### BuildKit Components to Address

**Docker BuildX Builders**:
- Remove existing builders: `docker buildx rm <builder-name>`
- Create new builders: `docker buildx create --name <name> --use`
- Configure builder settings: platform support, cache options

**BuildKit Cache Storage**:
- Location: `~/.buildkit/cache` or Docker-managed locations
- Cleanup: Remove cache directories and files
- Configuration: Set cache size limits and retention policies

**Docker Desktop Integration**:
- BuildKit enablement in Docker Desktop settings
- Builder configuration and platform support
- Integration with development IDEs and tools

### Configuration Validation

**Builder Functionality Tests**:
```bash
# Test basic build functionality
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t test-image .

# Test multi-platform support
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 -t test-image-multi .

# Verify builder status
docker buildx ls
docker buildx inspect default
```

**Cache Operation Tests**:
```bash
# Test cache creation and usage
docker buildx build --cache-from type=local,src=/tmp/cache --cache-to type=local,dest=/tmp/cache .

# Verify cache location and contents
ls -la ~/.buildkit/cache/
```

**Integration Tests**:
- Test with IDE Docker integration
- Verify Docker Compose BuildKit usage
- Validate CI/CD pipeline compatibility (if applicable)

## Success Criteria

### Functional Success
- All BuildX builders operational without errors
- Desktop-linux builder functioning correctly
- Multi-platform build capability confirmed
- Cache operations working properly
- Integration with development tools verified

### Performance Success
- Build times comparable or better than before reinstallation
- Cache effectiveness restored or improved
- No regressions in build system performance
- Development workflows not negatively impacted

### Reliability Success
- Consistent BuildKit behavior across restarts
- No recurring errors or corruption issues
- Stable integration with Docker Desktop
- Reliable functionality for development team
