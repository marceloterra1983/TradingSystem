# BuildKit Reinstallation Rollback Plan

## Rollback Triggers
Reinstall BuildKit should be rolled back if any of the following occur:
1. BuildKit daemon fails to start after reinstallation
2. No builders are functional after reinstallation
3. Docker Desktop integration is broken
4. Build times increase significantly (>50% slower)
5. Existing build workflows stop working
6. Critical errors during reinstallation process

## Rollback Decision Timeline
- **Immediate (0-5 min)**: Critical errors during installation
- **Short-term (5-30 min)**: Basic functionality not working
- **Extended (30+ min)**: Performance or integration issues

## Rollback Procedure

### Step 1: Stop Reinstallation (if in progress)
```bash
# Stop any running BuildKit processes
pkill buildkit
# Switch to legacy Docker builder if needed
docker buildx use default
```

### Step 2: Restore Previous Configuration
```bash
# Use existing default builder (should still work)
docker buildx use default
docker buildx inspect default
```

### Step 3: Verify Basic Functionality
```bash
# Test basic build functionality
docker buildx build --help
docker buildx ls
```

### Step 4: Recreate desktop-linux builder (if needed)
```bash
# Attempt to recreate desktop-linux builder
docker buildx create --name desktop-linux --use --driver docker
```

### Step 5: Document Rollback
- Record rollback reason and time
- Document any remaining issues
- Update team on rollback status

## Rollback Verification
- [ ] Default builder is functional
- [ ] Basic build commands work
- [ ] Docker integration restored
- [ ] No critical errors in Docker daemon
- [ ] Team notified of rollback

## Emergency Procedures
### If Docker Daemon is Broken
1. Restart Docker Desktop
2. Restart Docker daemon: `sudo systemctl restart docker`
3. Check Docker daemon status: `docker system info`
4. Contact system administrator if issues persist

### If Build Commands Fail
1. Switch to legacy Docker build: `docker build` (without buildx)
2. Use `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0` to disable BuildKit temporarily
3. Document specific failures for troubleshooting

## Success Criteria
Rollback is successful when:
- Default builder works without errors
- Basic build functionality restored
- Docker Desktop integration working
- No performance degradation
- Team can continue development work

## Post-Rollback Actions
1. Document reasons for rollback
2. Analyze what went wrong with reinstallation
3. Plan alternative approach if needed
4. Update team on lessons learned
