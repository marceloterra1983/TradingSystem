# Agent Integration Platform Design

## Context

The trading system currently uses multiple AI agents for different purposes (documentation generation, analysis, monitoring) but lacks unified management. Agents are implemented using different frameworks (LangGraph, custom Python scripts, MCP servers) and deployed inconsistently. This creates operational complexity and makes it difficult to scale agent usage.

### Stakeholders
- **DevOps Team**: Needs centralized monitoring and deployment automation
- **Development Teams**: Need standardized patterns for creating new agents
- **System Administrators**: Need health monitoring and alerting capabilities
- **Security Team**: Need credential management and access control

## Goals / Non-Goals

### Goals
- Provide unified REST API for agent lifecycle management (start, stop, restart, update)
- Enable real-time health monitoring with automatic recovery capabilities
- Standardize agent configuration management with versioning and validation
- Create centralized logging and observability for all agent activities
- Support multiple agent frameworks through abstraction layer
- Enable secure inter-agent communication and event coordination
- Provide web-based dashboard for agent management and monitoring

### Non-Goals
- Replace existing agent implementations (incremental migration approach)
- Reinvent container orchestration (leverage Docker Compose)
- Create new programming languages or frameworks (support existing ones)
- Implement complex scheduling systems (basic cron-based scheduling sufficient)

## Decisions

### Decision: Agent Platform as Node.js/Express Service
**Rationale**:
- Consistent with existing microservices pattern in the project
- Excellent process management capabilities in Node.js ecosystem
- Rich ecosystem for monitoring, logging, and API development
- Easy integration with existing dashboard (React frontend)

**Alternatives considered**:
- Python Flask/FastAPI: Good for ML integration but inconsistent with other services
- Go: Excellent performance but overkill for orchestration tasks
- Docker Swarm/Kubernetes: Too complex for current scale, adds operational overhead

### Decision: QuestDB for Agent Metadata Storage
**Rationale**:
- Already used in the project for time-series data
- Excellent for storing agent metrics and status history
- Consistent with existing data persistence strategy

**Alternatives considered**:
- PostgreSQL: More complex than needed for agent metadata
- SQLite: Not suitable for concurrent access across services
- In-memory storage: Would lose agent state on restart

### Decision: Process-Based Agent Management (not container-based)
**Rationale**:
- Agents need access to host system resources (file system, network)
- Process-level monitoring provides better resource usage visibility
- Easier debugging and log access compared to containerized approach
- Simpler development experience for agent creators

**Alternatives considered**:
- Docker containers: Better isolation but adds complexity and resource overhead
- Kubernetes: Enterprise-grade but overly complex for current requirements
- Systemd services: Linux-only, harder to manage dynamically

### Decision: WebSocket for Real-Time Communication
**Rationale**:
- Existing pattern in the project for real-time updates
- Low latency for agent status changes and events
- Browser compatibility for dashboard integration

**Alternatives considered**:
- Server-Sent Events: Simpler but unidirectional only
- Message queues (RabbitMQ/Redis): More complex than needed
- HTTP polling: Higher latency and resource usage

## Risks / Trade-offs

### Risk: Agent Platform Single Point of Failure
**Mitigation**:
- Implement health checks and automatic restart
- Use process supervisors (PM2 or similar) for resilience
- Design stateless API layer where possible

### Risk: Resource Contention Between Agents
**Mitigation**:
- Implement resource usage monitoring and limits
- Prioritize critical agents (trading-related)
- Use process scheduling to prevent resource starvation

### Trade-off: Centralization vs Flexibility
- **Centralization approach chosen**: Easier management, monitoring, and consistency
- **Trade-off**: Less flexibility for custom agent implementations
- **Mitigation**: Provide extension points and hooks for custom requirements

### Risk: Security Exposure from Agent Management API
**Mitigation**:
- Implement authentication and authorization
- Use network segmentation for agent communication
- Validate all agent configurations and inputs
- Audit all management operations

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Core Platform (Week 1-2)
1. Implement Agent Platform service with basic CRUD operations
2. Create agent registry with QuestDB persistence
3. Add basic health monitoring for existing agents
4. Implement REST API endpoints for agent management

### Phase 2: Orchestration & Monitoring (Week 3-4)
1. Add process management capabilities (start/stop/restart)
2. Implement resource monitoring and alerting
3. Create unified logging pipeline
4. Add web dashboard for agent management

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 5-6)
1. Implement inter-agent communication bus
2. Add configuration versioning and rollback
3. Create backup/restore functionality
4. Migrate existing agents to platform

### Rollback Strategy
- All agents maintain their original startup methods
- Platform can be disabled without affecting existing agents
- Database schema changes are additive only
- API versioning prevents breaking changes

## Open Questions

1. **Agent Framework Support**: Should we prioritize LangGraph agents or provide equal support for all frameworks?
2. **Resource Limits**: What are reasonable default resource limits for different agent types?
3. **Security Model**: What level of isolation should be enforced between agents?
4. **Scalability**: How many concurrent agents should the platform support initially?
5. **Monitoring Frequency**: What polling interval provides good balance between responsiveness and resource usage?

## Performance Considerations

- **API Response Times**: Target <200ms for agent status queries
- **Monitoring Overhead**: <5% CPU usage impact on host system
- **Memory Footprint**: Platform service should use <512MB base memory
- **Concurrent Agents**: Support 50+ agents on modest hardware (8GB RAM)
- **Log Volume**: Handle 10MB+ of logs per hour without performance degradation

## Integration Points

### Existing Services
- **Service Launcher**: Coordinate startup sequence and dependencies
- **Documentation API**: Register documentation-related agents
- **Dashboard**: Provide management UI and real-time updates
- **QuestDB**: Store agent metadata and metrics

### External Systems
- **Docker**: For agent containerization (optional)
- **Prometheus**: Export metrics for monitoring
- **Grafana**: Visualization of agent performance
- **File System**: Agent configurations and state storage
