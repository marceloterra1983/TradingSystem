# Integrate LlamaIndex RAG Capabilities

## Summary

This change proposes integrating LlamaIndex to enhance our system's documentation and knowledge management capabilities through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This will provide intelligent search, contextual answers, and automated documentation maintenance across our technical documentation.

## Motivation

The current documentation system lacks semantic search and intelligent query capabilities. By integrating LlamaIndex, we can:

- Enable natural language queries across our documentation
- Maintain up-to-date and accurate documentation through automated indexing
- Provide context-aware answers using our own documentation as ground truth
- Scale knowledge management as the system grows
- Reduce time spent searching for information

## Approach

We'll implement this change through three main capability areas:

1. Data Ingestion & Storage
   - Connect to existing documentation sources (Markdown, API specs, code comments)
   - Transform content into embeddings
   - Store in a vector database (Qdrant)

2. Query Infrastructure
   - Deploy LlamaIndex query engine
   - Integrate with existing documentation API
   - Implement rate limiting and caching

3. Frontend Integration
   - Add semantic search UI components
   - Implement contextual documentation features
   - Display source references and confidence scores

## Risks and Mitigations

1. Performance Impact
   - Mitigation: Implement caching and batch processing for indexing
   - Use efficient vector storage and retrieval strategies

2. Accuracy and Relevance
   - Mitigation: Regular evaluation of query results
   - Implement feedback mechanisms for result quality

3. Resource Usage
   - Mitigation: Monitor embedding storage growth
   - Implement cleanup for outdated embeddings

## Timeline

- Phase 1 (2 weeks): Infrastructure setup and basic ingestion
- Phase 2 (2 weeks): Query engine and API integration
- Phase 3 (2 weeks): Frontend integration and testing
- Phase 4 (1 week): Production deployment and monitoring

## Success Metrics

- Query response time < 500ms
- Search result relevance > 90%
- Documentation coverage > 95%
- User satisfaction metrics for search functionality
