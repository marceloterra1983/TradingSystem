# LlamaIndex Integration Technical Design

## Architecture Overview

```
[Documentation Sources] -> [Ingestion Service] -> [Vector DB (Qdrant)]
                                              -> [Document Store]
                                                     â†“
[Frontend] <- [Documentation API] <- [Query Engine] <- [LlamaIndex]
```

## Components

### 1. Ingestion Service
- Python service using LlamaIndex data connectors
- Monitors documentation changes through file system events
- Handles document parsing, chunking, and embedding generation
- Manages vector database updates

### 2. Vector Storage (Qdrant)
- Stores document embeddings
- Provides efficient similarity search
- Supports metadata filtering
- Handles versioning of embeddings

### 3. Query Engine
- LlamaIndex query processor
- Handles query embedding and retrieval
- Implements context window management
- Provides relevance scoring

### 4. API Integration
- Extends documentation API with semantic search endpoints
- Implements query rate limiting
- Manages authentication and access control
- Provides debugging and monitoring endpoints

### 5. Frontend Components
- Search interface with semantic capabilities
- Context-aware documentation display
- Source attribution and confidence indicators
- Feedback collection mechanism

## Technical Decisions

### Vector Database Selection: Qdrant
- Native Python support
- Excellent performance characteristics
- Built-in filtering and metadata support
- Active community and maintenance

### Embedding Model: OpenAI Ada
- High quality embeddings
- Cost-effective for our scale
- Well-supported by LlamaIndex
- Can be replaced with local models if needed

### Architecture Patterns
- Event-driven ingestion
- Asynchronous processing
- Cache-first query responses
- Circuit breaker for external services

## Security Considerations

1. API Authentication
   - JWT-based access control
   - Rate limiting per user/token
   - Audit logging for sensitive operations

2. Data Protection
   - Encryption at rest for vector storage
   - Secure communication between services
   - Regular security scanning of dependencies

3. Privacy Controls
   - Configurable data retention
   - Source document access controls
   - PII detection and handling

## Monitoring and Observability

1. Metrics
   - Query latency and throughput
   - Embedding generation time
   - Storage utilization
   - Cache hit rates

2. Logging
   - Structured JSON logging
   - Correlation IDs across services
   - Error aggregation and alerting

3. Alerting
   - Performance degradation
   - Error rate thresholds
   - Resource utilization warnings
   - Service health checks
