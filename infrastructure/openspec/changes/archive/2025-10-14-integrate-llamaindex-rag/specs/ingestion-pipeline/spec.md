# LlamaIndex Ingestion Pipeline Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Document Source Integration
#### Requirement: The system must support ingestion from multiple documentation sources
#### Scenario: Project Documentation Update
- Given new markdown documentation is added to the docs/ directory
- When the file system watcher detects the change
- Then the ingestion pipeline should process the new content
- And generate embeddings for the new content
- And store the embeddings in the vector database
- And update the document metadata index

### Document Processing
#### Requirement: Documents must be properly chunked and embedded for optimal retrieval
#### Scenario: Large Technical Document Processing
- Given a large technical specification document
- When the document is processed by the ingestion pipeline
- Then it should be split into semantic chunks
- And each chunk should maintain context and coherence
- And chunk size should be optimized for the embedding model
- And chunk overlaps should preserve context across boundaries

### Vector Storage Management
#### Requirement: Embeddings must be efficiently stored and indexed in Qdrant
#### Scenario: Efficient Vector Storage
- Given processed document chunks and their embeddings
- When storing in Qdrant
- Then each embedding should be stored with relevant metadata
- And the storage should support efficient similarity search
- And the system should maintain vector versioning
- And support batch operations for performance

### Change Detection
#### Requirement: The system must efficiently detect and process documentation changes
#### Scenario: Documentation Update
- Given an existing document is modified
- When the change is detected
- Then only modified sections should be reprocessed
- And existing embeddings for unchanged content should be preserved
- And the vector database should be updated incrementally

### Error Handling
#### Requirement: The pipeline must handle errors gracefully and maintain data consistency
#### Scenario: Failed Processing Recovery
- Given a document processing failure occurs
- When the error is detected
- Then the system should log detailed error information
- And maintain a record of failed documents
- And support manual reprocessing of failed items
- And ensure partial updates don't corrupt the index

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Documentation API Integration
#### Requirement: Extend existing documentation API to support vector operations
#### Scenario: API Extension
- Given the existing documentation API
- When integrating vector storage capabilities
- Then add new endpoints for vector operations
- And maintain backward compatibility
- And implement proper error handling
- And provide monitoring endpoints

## Performance Requirements

### Processing Speed
#### Requirement: Document processing must complete within acceptable timeframes
#### Scenario: Batch Processing Performance
- Given a batch of new documentation files
- When processing through the ingestion pipeline
- Then complete initial processing within 5 minutes
- And maintain system responsiveness
- And optimize resource usage
- And provide progress monitoring

### Resource Usage
#### Requirement: Resource utilization must be optimized and monitored
#### Scenario: Resource Monitoring
- Given the ingestion pipeline is running
- When processing documents
- Then CPU usage should not exceed 70%
- And memory usage should be stable
- And disk I/O should be optimized
- And provide resource usage metrics

## Security Requirements

### Data Protection
#### Requirement: Sensitive information must be properly handled during ingestion
#### Scenario: Sensitive Content Detection
- Given a document containing sensitive information
- When processing through the pipeline
- Then detect and flag sensitive content
- And apply appropriate access controls
- And maintain audit logs
- And ensure secure storage

## Monitoring Requirements

### Pipeline Health
#### Requirement: The pipeline must provide comprehensive health and performance metrics
#### Scenario: Health Monitoring
- Given the ingestion pipeline is operational
- When monitoring system health
- Then track processing success rates
- And measure processing latency
- And monitor resource utilization
- And provide alerting for issues
