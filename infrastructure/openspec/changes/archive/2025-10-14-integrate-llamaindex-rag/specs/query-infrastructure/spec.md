# LlamaIndex Query Infrastructure Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Query Processing
#### Requirement: The system must effectively process natural language queries
#### Scenario: Natural Language Search
- Given a user submits a natural language question
- When the query engine processes the request
- Then convert the query to an embedding
- And perform similarity search in the vector database
- And retrieve relevant document chunks
- And generate a coherent response using RAG
- And include source references

### Response Generation
#### Requirement: Responses must be accurate and well-supported
#### Scenario: Contextual Answer Generation
- Given relevant document chunks are retrieved
- When generating the response
- Then use RAG to combine chunks with the query
- And ensure factual accuracy
- And provide confidence scores
- And cite source documents
- And maintain answer coherence

### Caching System
#### Requirement: Implement efficient caching for improved performance
#### Scenario: Query Caching
- Given a frequently asked query
- When the same query is received
- Then check the cache first
- And return cached results if available
- And update cache hit metrics
- And maintain cache freshness
- And implement cache invalidation

### Rate Limiting
#### Requirement: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
#### Scenario: Query Rate Control
- Given an authenticated user
- When making multiple queries
- Then enforce rate limits per user/token
- And provide clear rate limit headers
- And implement graceful throttling
- And log rate limit violations
- And alert on abuse patterns

## MODIFIED Requirements

### API Integration
#### Requirement: Integrate with existing documentation API
#### Scenario: API Extension
- Given the existing documentation API
- When adding query capabilities
- Then implement new query endpoints
- And maintain existing endpoint functionality
- And ensure consistent error handling
- And provide appropriate documentation
- And implement proper versioning

## Performance Requirements

### Query Response Time
#### Requirement: Queries must be processed within acceptable timeframes
#### Scenario: Query Performance
- Given a user submits a query
- When processing the request
- Then return results within 500ms
- And maintain response time under load
- And implement timeout handling
- And provide performance metrics

### Resource Management
#### Requirement: Query processing must efficiently use system resources
#### Scenario: Resource Optimization
- Given multiple concurrent queries
- When processing requests
- Then efficiently manage memory usage
- And optimize CPU utilization
- And implement connection pooling
- And provide resource monitoring

## Security Requirements

### Query Authentication
#### Requirement: All queries must be properly authenticated
#### Scenario: Secure Query Processing
- Given a query request
- When validating the request
- Then verify authentication token
- And check authorization level
- And validate request parameters
- And maintain security logs

### Data Access Control
#### Requirement: Enforce appropriate access controls on query results
#### Scenario: Access Control
- Given a query returns sensitive information
- When preparing the response
- Then apply document-level access controls
- And filter results based on user permissions
- And log access attempts
- And maintain audit trail

## Monitoring Requirements

### Query Analytics
#### Requirement: Track and analyze query patterns and performance
#### Scenario: Query Monitoring
- Given the query system is operational
- When processing queries
- Then track query success rates
- And measure response times
- And monitor resource usage
- And generate usage reports
- And alert on anomalies

### Error Tracking
#### Requirement: Comprehensive error tracking and reporting
#### Scenario: Error Handling
- Given a query processing error occurs
- When handling the error
- Then log detailed error information
- And provide meaningful error messages
- And maintain error statistics
- And trigger appropriate alerts
- And support error investigation
