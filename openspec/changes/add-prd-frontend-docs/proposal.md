# Proposal: Add PRD & Frontend Sections to Docs

## Why
- Product and frontend teams lack a purposeful home inside the published documentation, so PRDs and UI engineering standards live in scattered files under `docs/`.
- Cross-functional workflows (backend → frontend, product → engineering) need explicit crosslinks and navigation to keep requirements synchronized.
- Automation is missing to keep PRD indices and design token documentation current, causing drift and stale references between Markdown and JSON sources.

## What Changes
- Establish structured `docs/context/prd` and `docs/context/frontend` trees with opinionated templates, category metadata, and representative starter pages surfaced by the Docusaurus sidebar.
- Extend doc tooling with scripts that index PRDs per product line, sync design token tables from the source JSON, and expand the scaffolding command for PRD/frontend pages.
- Update navigation, package scripts, and CI governance so PRD/frontend updates appear in the sidebar, run via `npm run docs:auto`, and trigger impact checks in pull requests.

## Impact
- Adds new documentation surfaces that require ongoing ownership from product and frontend teams.
- Introduces additional doc automation executed by `npm run docs:auto`, increasing the required dependencies for local development and CI nodes.
- Pull request templates and validation gates must expand to cover PRD/Frontend impact, raising the bar for cross-team coordination.
